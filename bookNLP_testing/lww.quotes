811	822	824	824	Peter	38	" We 've fallen on our feet and no mistake , "
826	846	824	824	Peter	38	" This is going to be perfectly splendid . That old chap will let us do anything we like . "
847	856	858	858	Susan	40	" I think he 's an old dear , "
860	867	869	869	Edmund	36	" Oh , come off it ! "
889	898	869	869	Edmund	36	" Do n't go on talking like that . "
899	903	905	905	Susan	40	" Like what ? "
907	919	905	905	Susan	40	" and anyway , it 's time you were in bed . "
920	927	929	929	Edmund	36	" Trying to talk like Mother , "
931	951	929	929	Edmund	36	" And who are you to say when I 'm to go to bed ? Go to bed yourself . "
952	962	964	964	Lucy	60	" Had n't we all better go to bed ? "
966	981	964	964	Lucy	60	" There 's sure to be a row if we 're heard talking here . "
982	988	990	990	Peter	38	" No there wo n't , "
992	1046	990	990	Peter	38	" I tell you this is the sort of house where no one 's going to mind what we do . Anyway , they wo n't hear us . It 's about ten minutes ' walk from here down to that dining room , and any amount of stairs and passages in between . "
1047	1053	1055	1055	Lucy	60	" What 's that noise ? "
1097	1106	1108	1108	Edmund	36	" It 's only a bird , silly , "
1110	1116	1118	1118	Peter	38	" It 's an owl , "
1120	1190	1118	1118	Peter	38	" This is going to be a wonderful place for birds . I shall go to bed now . I say , let 's go and explore to - morrow . You might find anything in a place like this . Did you see those mountains as we came along ? And the woods ? There might be eagles . There might be stags . There 'll be hawks . "
1191	1194	1196	1196	Lucy	60	" Badgers ! "
1198	1201	1203	1203	Edmund	36	" Snakes ! "
1205	1208	1210	1210	Susan	40	" Foxes ! "
1252	1262	1264	1264	Edmund	36	" Of course it _ would _ be raining ! "
1305	1312	1314	1314	Susan	40	" Do stop grumbling , Ed , "
1316	1349	1314	1314	Susan	40	" Ten to one it 'll clear up in an hour or so . And in the meantime we 're pretty well off . There 's a wireless and lots of books . "
1350	1355	1357	1357	Peter	38	" Not for me , "
1359	1369	1357	1357	Peter	38	" I 'm going to explore in the house . "
1581	1585	1587	1587	Peter	38	" Nothing there ! "
1806	1815	1817	1817	Lucy	60	" This must be a simply enormous wardrobe ! "
1850	1860	1861	1861	she	60	" I wonder is that more moth - balls ? "
1899	1905	1906	1906	she	60	" This is very queer , "
1945	1956	1958	1958	Lucy	60	" Why , it is just like branches of trees ! "
2131	2142	2144	2144	Lucy	60	" I can always get back if anything goes wrong , "
2469	2474	2476	2477	the Faun	179	" Goodness gracious me ! "
2487	2491	2493	2493	Lucy	60	" Good evening , "
2524	2531	2533	2534	the Faun	47	" Good evening , good evening , "
2536	2563	2533	2534	the Faun	47	" Excuse me -- I do n't want to be inquisitive -- but should I be right in thinking that you are a Daughter of Eve ? "
2564	2570	2572	2572	she	60	" My name 's Lucy , "
2579	2595	2597	2598	the Faun	179	" But you are -- forgive me -- you are what they call a girl ? "
2600	2608	2610	2610	Lucy	60	" Of course I 'm a girl , "
2612	2619	2533	2534	the Faun	47	" You are in fact Human ? "
2620	2627	2629	2629	Lucy	60	" Of course I 'm human , "
2636	2645	2647	2648	the Faun	47	" To be sure , to be sure , "
2650	2680	2683	2683	he	47	" How stupid of me ! But I 've never seen a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve before . I am delighted . That is to say-- "
2704	2709	2710	2710	he	47	" Delighted , delighted , "
2714	2726	2710	2710	he	47	" Allow me to introduce myself . My name is Tumnus . "
2727	2739	2741	2741	Lucy	60	" I am very pleased to meet you , Mr. Tumnus , "
2743	2756	2758	2759	Mr. Tumnus	49	" And may I ask , O Lucy , Daughter of Eve , "
2761	2769	2758	2759	Mr. Tumnus	49	" how you have come into Narnia ? "
2770	2777	2779	2779	Lucy	60	" Narnia ? What 's that ? "
2781	2789	2791	2792	the Faun	179	" This is the land of Narnia , "
2794	2834	2791	2792	the Faun	179	" where we are now ; all that lies between the lamp - post and the great castle of Cair Paravel on the eastern sea . And you -- you have come from the wild woods of the west ? "
2835	2849	2851	2851	Lucy	60	" I -- I got in through the wardrobe in the spare room , "
2853	2856	2858	2859	Mr. Tumnus	49	" Ah ! "
2866	2899	2858	2859	Mr. Tumnus	49	" if only I had worked harder at geography when I was a little Faun , I should no doubt know all about those strange countries . It is too late now . "
2900	2909	2911	2911	Lucy	60	" But they are n't countries at all , "
2916	2936	2911	2911	Lucy	60	" It 's only just back there -- at least -- I'm not sure . It is summer there . "
2937	2940	2942	2943	Mr. Tumnus	49	" Meanwhile , "
2945	3010	2942	2943	Mr. Tumnus	49	" it is winter in Narnia , and has been for ever so long , and we shall both catch cold if we stand here talking in the snow . Daughter of Eve from the far land of Spare Oom where eternal summer reigns around the bright city of War Drobe , how would it be if you came and had tea with me ? "
3011	3020	3022	3022	Lucy	60	" Thank you very much , Mr. Tumnus , "
3024	3037	3022	3022	Lucy	60	" But I was wondering whether I ought to be getting back . "
3038	3047	3049	3050	the Faun	179	" It 's only just round the corner , "
3052	3070	3049	3050	the Faun	179	" and there 'll be a roaring fire -- and toast -- and sardines -- and cake . "
3071	3081	3083	3083	Lucy	60	" Well , it 's very kind of you , "
3085	3096	3083	3083	Lucy	60	" But I sha n't be able to stay long . "
3097	3109	3111	3112	Mr. Tumnus	49	" If you will take my arm , Daughter of Eve , "
3114	3139	3111	3112	Mr. Tumnus	49	" I shall be able to hold the umbrella over both of us . That 's the way . Now -- off we go . "
3288	3296	3297	3297	he	49	" Now we sha n't be long , "
3341	3351	3353	3354	Mr. Tumnus	49	" one for me and one for a friend , "
3465	3472	3474	3475	the Faun	47	" Now , Daughter of Eve ! "
3676	3686	3687	3687	he	49	" Not that it is n't always winter now , "
3760	3797	3754	3754	she	60	" Oh Mr. Tumnus -- I'm so sorry to stop you , and I do love that tune -- but really , I must go home . I only meant to stay for a few minutes . "
3798	3810	3812	3813	the Faun	179	" It 's no good _ now _ , you know , "
3828	3832	3834	3834	Lucy	60	" No good ? "
3843	3869	3834	3834	Lucy	60	" What do you mean ? I 've got to go home at once . The others will be wondering what has happened to me . "
3877	3886	3874	3874	she	60	" Mr. Tumnus ! Whatever is the matter ? "
3934	3941	3943	3943	Lucy	60	" Mr. Tumnus ! Mr. Tumnus ! "
3948	3976	3943	3943	Lucy	60	" Do n't ! Do n't ! What is the matter ? Are n't you well ? Dear Mr. Tumnus , do tell me what is wrong . "
4051	4055	4057	4057	Lucy	60	" Mr. Tumnus ! "
4065	4097	4057	4057	Lucy	60	" Do stop . Stop it at once ! You ought to be ashamed of yourself , a great big Faun like you . What on earth are you crying about ? "
4098	4105	4107	4108	Mr. Tumnus	49	" Oh -- oh -- oh ! "
4110	4122	4107	4108	Mr. Tumnus	49	" I 'm crying because I 'm such a bad Faun . "
4123	4136	4138	4138	Lucy	60	" I do n't think you 're a bad Faun at all , "
4140	4160	4138	4138	Lucy	60	" I think you are a very good Faun . You are the nicest Faun I 've ever met . "
4161	4175	4177	4178	Mr. Tumnus	49	" Oh -- oh -- you would n't say that if you knew , "
4183	4209	4177	4178	Mr. Tumnus	49	" No , I 'm a bad Faun . I do n't suppose there ever was a worse Faun since the beginning of the world . "
4210	4217	4219	4219	Lucy	60	" But what have you done ? "
4221	4228	4230	4231	Mr. Tumnus	49	" My old father , now , "
4233	4252	4230	4231	Mr. Tumnus	49	" that 's his picture over the mantelpiece . He would never have done a thing like this . "
4253	4259	4261	4261	Lucy	60	" A thing like what ? "
4263	4270	4272	4273	the Faun	47	" Like what I 've done , "
4275	4299	4272	4273	the Faun	47	" Taken service under the White Witch . That 's what I am . I 'm in the pay of the White Witch . "
4300	4309	4230	4231	Mr. Tumnus	49	" The White Witch ? Who is she ? "
4310	4344	4272	4273	the Faun	47	" Why , it is she that has got all Narnia under her thumb . It 's she that makes it always winter . Always winter and never Christmas ; think of that ! "
4345	4349	4351	4351	Lucy	60	" How awful ! "
4353	4362	4351	4351	Lucy	60	" But what does she pay you for ? "
4363	4371	4373	4374	Mr. Tumnus	49	" That 's the worst of it , "
4380	4465	4373	4374	Mr. Tumnus	49	" I 'm a kidnapper for her , that 's what I am . Look at me , Daughter of Eve . Would you believe that I 'm the sort of Faun to meet a poor innocent child in the wood , one that had never done me any harm , and pretend to be friendly with it , and invite it home to my cave , all for the sake of lulling it asleep and then handing it over to the White Witch ? "
4466	4469	4471	4471	Lucy	60	" No , "
4473	4486	4471	4471	Lucy	60	" I 'm sure you would n't do anything of the sort . "
4487	4492	4494	4495	the Faun	47	" But I have , "
4497	4500	4502	4502	Lucy	60	" Well , "
4523	4549	4502	4502	Lucy	60	" well , that was pretty bad . But you 're so sorry for it that I 'm sure you will never do it again . "
4550	4560	4562	4563	the Faun	47	" Daughter of Eve , do n't you understand ? "
4565	4586	4562	4563	the Faun	47	" It is n't something I _ have _ done . I 'm doing it now , this very moment . "
4587	4593	4595	4595	Lucy	60	" What do you mean ? "
4601	4607	4609	4610	Mr. Tumnus	49	" You are the child , "
4612	4696	4609	4610	Mr. Tumnus	49	" I had orders from the White Witch that if ever I saw a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve in the wood , I was to catch them and hand them over to her . And you are the first I ever met . And I 've pretended to be your friend and asked you to tea , and all the time I 've been meaning to wait till you were asleep and then go and tell _ her _ . "
4697	4707	4709	4709	Lucy	60	" Oh but you wo n't , Mr. Tumnus , "
4711	4727	4709	4709	Lucy	60	" You wo n't , will you ? Indeed , indeed you really must n't . "
4728	4735	4737	4737	he	215	" And if I do n't , "
4744	4852	4737	4737	he	215	" she 's sure to find out . And she 'll have my tail cut off , and my horns sawn off , and my beard plucked out , and she 'll wave her wand over my beautiful cloven hoofs and turn them into horrid solid hoofs like a wretched horse 's . And if she is extra and specially angry she 'll turn me into stone and I shall be only a statue of a Faun in her horrible house until the four thrones at Cair Paravel are filled -- and goodness knows when that will happen , or whether it will ever happen at all . "
4853	4862	4864	4864	Lucy	60	" I 'm very sorry , Mr. Tumnus , "
4866	4874	4864	4864	Lucy	60	" But please let me go home . "
4875	4881	4883	4884	the Faun	47	" Of course I will , "
4886	4968	4883	4884	the Faun	47	" Of course I 've got to . I see that now . I had n't known what Humans were like before I met you . Of course I ca n't give you up to the Witch ; not now that I know you . But we must be off at once . I 'll see you back to the lamp - post . I suppose you can find your own way from there back to Spare Oom and War Drobe ? "
4969	4976	4978	4978	Lucy	60	" I 'm sure I can , "
4980	4990	4992	4993	Mr. Tumnus	49	" We must go as quietly as we can , "
4995	5017	4992	4993	Mr. Tumnus	49	" The whole wood is full of _ her _ spies . Even some of the trees are on her side . "
5105	5118	5120	5120	Tumnus	49	" Do you know your way from here , Daughter of Eve ? "
5145	5148	5149	5149	she	60	" Yes , "
5152	5160	5149	5149	she	60	" I can see the wardrobe door . "
5161	5172	5174	5175	the Faun	179	" Then be off home as quick as you can , "
5177	5194	5174	5175	the Faun	179	" and -- c - can you ever forgive me for what I meant to do ? "
5195	5203	5205	5205	Lucy	60	" Why , of course I can , "
5214	5230	5205	5205	Lucy	60	" And I do hope you wo n't get into dreadful trouble on my account . "
5231	5238	5240	5240	he	49	" Farewell , Daughter of Eve , "
5242	5250	5240	5240	he	49	" Perhaps I may keep the handkerchief ? "
5251	5254	5256	5256	Lucy	60	" Rather ! "
5362	5367	5368	5368	she	60	" I 'm here , "
5371	5386	5368	5368	she	60	" I 'm here . I 've come back , I 'm all right . "
5411	5417	5418	5418	she	60	" It 's all right , "
5421	5427	5418	5418	she	60	" I 've come back . "
5428	5439	5441	5441	Susan	40	" What on earth are you talking about , Lucy ? "
5443	5446	5448	5448	Lucy	60	" Why ? "
5452	5463	5448	5448	Lucy	60	" have n't you all been wondering where I was ? "
5464	5474	5476	5476	Peter	38	" So you 've been hiding , have you ? "
5478	5506	5476	5476	Peter	38	" Poor old Lu , hiding and nobody noticed ! You 'll have to hide longer than that if you want people to start looking for you . "
5507	5518	5520	5520	Lucy	60	" But I 've been away for hours and hours , "
5530	5533	5535	5535	Edmund	36	" Batty ! "
5540	5544	5535	5535	Edmund	36	" Quite batty . "
5545	5553	5555	5555	Peter	38	" What do you mean , Lu ? "
5557	5562	5564	5564	Lucy	60	" What I said , "
5566	5601	5564	5564	Lucy	60	" It was just after breakfast when I went into the wardrobe , and I 've been away for hours and hours , and had tea , and all sorts of things have happened . "
5602	5610	5612	5612	Susan	40	" Do n't be silly , Lucy , "
5614	5634	5612	5612	Susan	40	" We 've only just come out of that room a moment ago , and you were there then . "
5635	5644	5646	5646	Peter	38	" She 's not being silly at all , "
5648	5671	5646	5646	Peter	38	" she 's just making up a story for fun , are n't you , Lu ? And why should n't she ? "
5672	5681	5682	5682	she	60	" No , Peter , I 'm not , "
5685	5724	5682	5682	she	60	" It's -- it 's a magic wardrobe . There 's a wood inside it , and it 's snowing , and there 's a Faun and a witch and it 's called Narnia ; come and see . "
5766	5776	5750	5750	She	60	" Now ! go in and see for yourselves . "
5777	5783	5785	5785	Susan	40	" Why , you goose , "
5798	5815	5785	5785	Susan	40	" it 's just an ordinary wardrobe , look ! there 's the back of it . "
5877	5885	5886	5886	he	38	" A jolly good hoax , Lu , "
5894	5911	5886	5886	he	38	" you have really taken us in , I must admit . We half believed you . "
5912	5922	5924	5924	Lucy	60	" But it was n't a hoax at all , "
5926	5946	5924	5924	Lucy	60	" really and truly . It was all different a moment ago . Honestly it was . I promise . "
5947	5952	5954	5954	Peter	38	" Come , Lu , "
5956	5978	5954	5954	Peter	38	" that 's going a bit far . You 've had your joke . Had n't you better drop it now ? "
6256	6258	6254	6254	Susan	40	" It "
6531	6542	6544	6544	Edmund	36	" She thinks I 'm Susan come to catch her , "
6548	6561	6544	6544	Edmund	36	" and so she 's keeping very quiet in at the back . "
6653	6668	6648	6648	he	36	" Lucy ! Lu ! Where are you ? I know you 're here . "
6718	6722	6724	6724	Edmund	36	" Thank goodness , "
6726	6738	6724	6724	Edmund	36	" the door must have swung open of its own accord . "
6929	6932	6948	6948	she	60	" imaginary country "
6959	6971	6956	6956	he	36	" Lucy ! Lucy ! I 'm here too -- Edmund . "
6977	6991	6993	6993	Edmund	36	" She 's angry about all the things I 've been saying lately , "
7031	7063	7027	7027	he	36	" I say , Lu ! I 'm sorry I did n't believe you . I see now you were right all along . Do come out . Make it Pax . "
7070	7076	7080	7080	himself	36	" Just like a girl , "
7082	7093	7080	7080	himself	36	" sulking somewhere , and wo n't accept an apology . "
7422	7425	7427	7428	the Lady	264	" Stop ! "
7472	7481	7483	7484	the Lady	264	" And what , pray , are you ? "
7491	7501	7503	7503	Edmund	36	" I'm -- I'm -- my name 's Edmund , "
7522	7531	7532	7532	she	264	" Is that how you address a Queen ? "
7540	7554	7556	7556	Edmund	36	" I beg your pardon , your Majesty , I did n't know , "
7558	7566	7568	7568	she	264	" Not know the Queen of Narnia ? "
7570	7588	7568	7568	she	264	" Ha ! You shall know us better hereafter . But I repeat -- what are you ? "
7589	7595	7597	7597	Edmund	36	" Please , your Majesty , "
7599	7624	7597	7597	Edmund	36	" I do n't know what you mean . I 'm at school -- at least I was -- it 's the holidays now . "
7631	7637	7639	7640	the Queen	269	" But what are you ? "
7643	7657	7639	7640	the Queen	269	" Are you a great overgrown dwarf that has cut off its beard . "
7658	7664	7666	7666	Edmund	36	" No , your Majesty , "
7668	7680	7666	7666	Edmund	36	" I never had a beard , I 'm a boy . "
7681	7685	7687	7687	she	269	" A boy ! "
7689	7700	7687	7687	she	269	" Do you mean you are a Son of Adam ? "
7722	7736	7738	7739	the Queen	269	" I see you are an idiot , whatever else you may be , "
7741	7761	7738	7739	the Queen	269	" Answer me , once and for all , or I shall lose my patience . Are you human ? "
7762	7768	7770	7770	Edmund	36	" Yes , your Majesty , "
7772	7786	7738	7739	the Queen	269	" And how , pray , did you come to enter my dominions ? "
7787	7800	7738	7739	the Queen	269	" Please , your Majesty , I came in through a wardrobe . "
7801	7810	7738	7739	the Queen	269	" A wardrobe ? What do you mean ? "
7811	7827	7829	7829	Edmund	36	" I -- I opened a door and just found myself here , your Majesty , "
7831	7834	7836	7837	the Queen	269	" Ha ! "
7847	7884	7842	7842	herself	269	" A door . A door from the world of men ! I have heard of such things . This may wreck all . But he is only one , and he is easily dealt with . "
7952	7957	7958	7958	she	269	" My poor child , "
7966	7994	7958	7958	she	269	" how cold you look ! Come and sit with me here on the sledge and I will put my mantle around you and we will talk . "
8038	8045	8047	8048	the Queen	269	" Perhaps something hot to drink ? "
8050	8056	8047	8048	the Queen	269	" Should you like that ? "
8057	8064	8066	8066	Edmund	36	" Yes please , your Majesty , "
8220	8234	8236	8237	the Queen	269	" It is dull , Son of Adam , to drink without eating , "
8240	8249	8236	8237	the Queen	269	" What would you like best to eat ? "
8250	8259	8261	8261	Edmund	36	" Turkish Delight , please , your Majesty , "
8485	8496	8497	8497	she	269	" You are sure there are just four of you ? "
8500	8516	8497	8497	she	269	" Two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve , neither more nor less ? "
8532	8541	8518	8518	Edmund	36	" Yes , I told you that before , "
8547	8550	8546	8546	her	269	" Your Majesty "
8668	8695	8663	8663	she	269	" Son of Adam , I should so much like to see your brother and your two sisters . Will you bring them to see me ? "
8696	8701	8703	8703	Edmund	36	" I 'll try , "
8712	8763	8703	8703	Edmund	36	" Because , if you did come again -- bringing them with you of course -- I'd be able to give you some more Turkish Delight . I ca n't do it now , the magic will only work once . In my own house it would be another matter . "
8764	8775	8777	8777	Edmund	36	" Why ca n't we go to your house now ? "
8823	8833	8835	8836	the Queen	269	" It is a lovely place , my house , "
8838	8950	8835	8836	the Queen	269	" I am sure you would like it . There are whole rooms full of Turkish Delight , and what 's more , I have no children of my own . I want a nice boy whom I could bring up as a Prince and who would be King of Narnia when I am gone . While he was Prince he would wear a gold crown and eat Turkish Delight all day long ; and you are much the cleverest and handsomest young man I 've ever met . I think I would like to make you the Prince -- some day , when you bring the others to visit me . "
8951	8956	8958	8958	Edmund	36	" Why not now ? "
8988	8999	9001	9001	she	269	" Oh , but if I took you there now , "
9003	9062	9001	9001	she	269	" I should n't see your brother and your sisters . I very much want to know your charming relations . You are to be the Prince and -- later on -- the King ; that is understood . But you must have courtiers and nobles . I will make your brother a Duke and your sisters Duchesses . "
9063	9073	9075	9075	Edmund	36	" There 's nothing special about _ them _ , "
9077	9091	9075	9075	Edmund	36	" and , anyway , I could always bring them some other time . "
9092	9103	9105	9106	the Queen	269	" Ah , but once you were in my house , "
9108	9170	9105	9106	the Queen	269	" you might forget all about them . You would be enjoying yourself so much that you would n't want the bother of going to fetch them . No . You must go back to your own country now and come to me another day , _ with them _ , you understand . It is no good coming without them . "
9171	9186	9188	9188	Edmund	36	" But I do n't even know the way back to my own country , "
9190	9195	9197	9198	the Queen	269	" That 's easy , "
9200	9207	9208	9208	She	269	" Do you see that lamp ? "
9231	9252	9253	9253	she	269	" Straight on , beyond that , is the way to the World of Men . And now look the other way"--here
9258	9273	9253	9253	she	269	direction--"and tell me if you can see two little hills rising above the trees . "
9274	9280	9282	9282	Edmund	36	" I think I can , "
9284	9365	9253	9253	she	269	" Well my house is between those two hills . So next time you come you have only to find the lamp - post and look for those two hills and walk through the wood till you reach my house . You had better keep the river on your right when you get to it . But remember -- you must bring the others with you . I might have to be very angry with you if you came alone . "
9366	9373	9375	9375	Edmund	36	" I 'll do my best , "
9377	9384	9386	9387	the Queen	269	" And , by the way , "
9389	9519	9386	9387	the Queen	269	" you need n't tell them about me . It would be fun to keep it a secret between us two , would n't it ? Make it a surprise for them . Just bring them along to the two hills -- a clever boy like you will easily think of some excuse for doing that -- and when you come to my house you could just say ' Let 's see who lives here ' or something like that . I am sure that would be best . If your sister has met one of the Fauns , she may have heard strange stories about me -- nasty stories that might make her afraid to come to me . Fauns will say anything , you know , and now-- "
9520	9525	9527	9527	Edmund	36	" Please , please , "
9530	9549	9527	9527	Edmund	36	" please could n't I have just one piece of Turkish Delight to eat on the way home ? "
9550	9555	9557	9558	the Queen	269	" No , no , "
9563	9571	9557	9558	the Queen	269	" you must wait till next time . "
9603	9617	9595	9596	the Queen	269	" Next time ! Next time ! Do n't forget . Come soon . "
9650	9655	9656	9656	she	60	" Oh , Edmund ! "
9659	9674	9656	9656	she	60	" So you 've got in too ! Is n't it wonderful , and now-- "
9675	9679	9681	9681	Edmund	36	" All right , "
9683	9727	9681	9681	Edmund	36	" I see you were right and it is a magic wardrobe after all . I 'll say I 'm sorry if you like . But where on earth have you been all this time ? I 've been looking for you everywhere . "
9728	9744	9746	9746	Lucy	60	" If I 'd known you had got in I 'd have waited for you , "
9768	9822	9746	9746	Lucy	60	" I 've been having lunch with dear Mr. Tumnus , the Faun , and he 's very well and the White Witch has done nothing to him for letting me go , so he thinks she ca n't have found out and perhaps everything is going to be all right after all . "
9823	9828	9830	9830	Edmund	36	" The White Witch ? "
9832	9837	9830	9830	Edmund	36	" who 's she ? "
9838	9846	9848	9848	Lucy	60	" She is a perfectly terrible person , "
9850	9959	9848	9848	Lucy	60	" She calls herself the Queen of Narnia though she has no right to be queen at all , and all the Fauns and Dryads and Naiads and dwarfs and animals -- at least all the good ones -- simply hate her . And she can turn people into stone and do all kinds of horrible things . And she has made a magic so that it is always winter in Narnia -- always winter , but it never gets to Christmas . And she drives about on a sledge , drawn by a reindeer , with her wand in her hand and a crown on her head . "
10011	10023	10024	10024	he	36	" Who told you all that stuff about the White Witch ? "
10027	10034	10036	10036	Lucy	60	" Mr. Tumnus , the Faun , "
10038	10048	10050	10050	Edmund	36	" You ca n't always believe what Fauns say , "
10066	10071	10073	10073	Lucy	60	" Who said so ? "
10075	10080	10082	10082	Edmund	36	" Everyone knows it , "
10084	10107	10082	10082	Edmund	36	" ask anybody you like . But it 's pretty poor sport standing here in the snow . Let 's go home . "
10108	10114	10116	10116	Lucy	60	" Yes , let 's , "
10118	10156	10116	10116	Lucy	60	" Oh Edmund , I _ am _ glad you 've got in too . The others will have to believe in Narnia now that both of us have been there . What fun it will be . "
10283	10287	10289	10289	Lucy	60	" I say , "
10291	10305	10289	10289	Lucy	60	" you do look awful , Edmund . Do n't you feel well ? "
10306	10312	10314	10314	Edmund	36	" I 'm all right , "
10328	10333	10335	10335	Lucy	60	" Come on then , "
10337	10370	10335	10335	Lucy	60	" let 's find the others . What a lot we shall have to tell them ! And what wonderful adventures we shall have now that we 're all in it together . "
10435	10492	10431	10431	Lucy	60	" Peter ! Susan ! It 's all true . Edmund has seen it too . There is a country you can get to through the wardrobe . Edmund and I both got in . We met one another in there , in the wood . Go on , Edmund ; tell them all about it . "
10493	10502	10504	10504	Peter	38	" What 's all this about , Ed ? "
10585	10591	10593	10593	Susan	40	" Tell us , Ed , "
10628	10667	10604	10604	he	36	" Oh , yes , Lucy and I have been playing -- pretending that all her story about a country in the wardrobe is true . Just for fun , of course . There 's nothing there really . "
10709	10732	10694	10694	he	36	" There she goes again . What 's the matter with her ? That 's the worst of young kids , they always-- "
10733	10737	10739	10739	Peter	38	" Look here , "
10745	10791	10739	10739	Peter	38	" shut up ! You 've been perfectly beastly to Lu ever since she started this nonsense about the wardrobe and now you go playing games with her about it and setting her off again . I believe you did it simply out of spite . "
10792	10799	10801	10801	Edmund	36	" But it 's all nonsense , "
10807	10815	10817	10817	Peter	38	" Of course it 's all nonsense , "
10819	10889	10817	10817	Peter	38	" that 's just the point . Lu was perfectly all right when we left home , but since we 've been down here she seems to be either going queer in the head or else turning into a most frightful liar . But whichever it is , what good do you think you 'll do by jeering and nagging at her one day and encouraging her the next ? "
10890	10897	10899	10899	Edmund	36	" I thought -- I thought , "
10911	10920	10922	10922	Peter	38	" You did n't think anything at all , "
10924	10951	10922	10922	Peter	38	" it 's just spite . You 've always liked being beastly to anyone smaller than yourself ; we 've seen that at school before now . "
10952	10957	10959	10959	Susan	40	" Do stop it , "
10961	10983	10959	10959	Susan	40	" it wo n't make things any better having a row between you two . Let 's go and find Lucy . "
11026	11088	11018	11018	She	40	" I do n't care what you think , and I do n't care what you say . You can tell the Professor or you can write to Mother or you can do anything you like . I know I 've met a Faun in there and -- I wish I 'd stayed there and you are all beasts , beasts . "
11174	11191	11193	11193	Peter	38	" He 'll write to Father if he thinks there is really something wrong with Lu , "
11195	11202	11193	11193	Peter	38	" it 's getting beyond us . "
11217	11221	11214	11215	the Professor	136	" Come in , "
11291	11297	11298	11298	he	136	" How do you know ? "
11301	11311	11298	11298	he	136	" that your sister 's story is not true ? "
11312	11316	11318	11318	Susan	40	" Oh , but-- "
11347	11357	11340	11340	Susan	40	" But Edmund said they had only been pretending . "
11358	11364	11366	11367	the Professor	136	" That is a point , "
11369	11418	11366	11367	the Professor	136	" which certainly deserves consideration ; very careful consideration . For instance -- if you will excuse me for asking the question -- does your experience lead you to regard your brother or your sister as the more reliable ? I mean , which is the more truthful ? "
11419	11431	11433	11433	Peter	38	" That 's just the funny thing about it , Sir , "
11435	11448	11433	11433	Peter	38	" Up till now , I 'd have said Lucy every time . "
11449	11459	11461	11462	the Professor	136	" And what do you think , my dear ? "
11468	11471	11473	11473	Susan	40	" Well , "
11475	11503	11473	11473	Susan	40	" in general , I 'd say the same as Peter , but this could n't be true -- all this about the wood and the Faun . "
11504	11512	11514	11515	the Professor	136	" That is more than I know , "
11517	11543	11514	11515	the Professor	136	" and a charge of lying against someone whom you have always found truthful is a very serious thing ; a very serious thing indeed . "
11544	11555	11557	11557	Susan	40	" We were afraid it might n't even be lying , "
11559	11570	11557	11557	Susan	40	" We thought there might be something wrong with Lucy . "
11571	11577	11579	11580	the Professor	136	" Madness , you mean ? "
11584	11615	11579	11580	the Professor	136	" Oh , you can make your minds easy about that . One has only to look at her and talk to her to see that she is not mad . "
11616	11620	11622	11622	Susan	40	" But then , "
11648	11651	11653	11654	the Professor	136	" Logic ! "
11659	11734	11653	11654	the Professor	136	" Why do n't they teach logic at these schools ? There are only three possibilities . Either your sister is telling lies , or she is mad , or she is telling the truth . You know she does n't tell lies and it is obvious that she is not mad . For the moment then and unless any further evidence turns up , we must assume that she is telling the truth . "
11760	11770	11772	11772	Peter	38	" But how could it be true , Sir ? "
11774	11781	11783	11784	the Professor	136	" Why do you say that ? "
11786	11793	11795	11795	Peter	38	" Well , for one thing , "
11797	11836	11795	11795	Peter	38	" if it was real why does n't everyone find this country every time they go to the wardrobe ? I mean , there was nothing there when we looked ; even Lucy did n't pretend there was . "
11837	11846	11848	11849	the Professor	136	" What has that to do with it ? "
11851	11868	11795	11795	Peter	38	" Well , Sir , if things are real , they 're there all the time . "
11869	11873	11875	11876	the Professor	136	" Are they ? "
11888	11895	11897	11897	Susan	40	" But there was no time , "
11899	11950	11897	11897	Susan	40	" Lucy had had no time to have gone anywhere , even if there was such a place . She came running after us the very moment we were out of the room . It was less than a minute , and she pretended to have been away for hours . "
11951	11967	11969	11970	the Professor	136	" That is the very thing that makes her story so likely to be true , "
11972	12102	11969	11970	the Professor	136	" If there really is a door in this house that leads to some other world ( and I should warn you that this is a very strange house , and even I know very little about it)--if , I say , she had got into another world , I should not be at all surprised to find that that other world had a separate time of its own ; so that however long you stayed there it would never take up any of our time . On the other hand , I do n't think many girls of her age would invent that idea for themselves . If she had been pretending , she would have hidden for a reasonable time before coming out and telling her story . "
12103	12112	12114	12114	Peter	38	" But do you really mean , Sir , "
12116	12137	12114	12114	Peter	38	" that there could be other worlds -- all over the place , just round the corner -- like that ? "
12138	12144	12146	12147	the Professor	136	" Nothing is more probable , "
12165	12177	12160	12160	he	136	" I wonder what they do teach them at these schools . "
12178	12186	12188	12188	Susan	40	" But what are we to do ? "
12203	12209	12211	12212	the Professor	136	" My dear young lady , "
12227	12245	12211	12212	the Professor	136	" there is one plan which no one has yet suggested and which is well worth trying . "
12246	12251	12253	12253	Susan	40	" What 's that ? "
12255	12265	12267	12267	he	136	" We might all try minding our own business , "
12529	12551	12508	12508	She	41	" And please remember you 're to keep out of the way whenever I 'm taking a party over the house . "
12552	12577	12579	12579	Edmund	36	" Just as if any of us would want to waste half the morning trailing round with a crowd of strange grown - ups ! "
12634	12649	12624	12626	the two girls	355	" Look out ! Here comes the Macready and a whole gang with her . "
12650	12656	12658	12658	Peter	38	" Sharp 's the word , "
12788	12816	12785	12785	Susan	40	" Oh bother those trippers ! Here -- let 's get into the Wardrobe Room till they 've passed . No one will follow us in there . "
12846	12849	12851	12851	Peter	38	" Quick ! "
12853	12859	12851	12851	Peter	38	" there 's nowhere else , "
12927	12942	12944	12944	Susan	40	" I wish the Macready would hurry up and take all these people away , "
12947	12954	12944	12944	Susan	40	" I 'm getting horribly cramped . "
12955	12964	12966	12966	Edmund	36	" And what a filthy smell of camphor ! "
12968	12981	12983	12983	Susan	40	" I expect the pockets of these coats are full of it , "
12985	12991	12983	12983	Susan	40	" to keep away moths . "
12992	13001	13003	13003	Peter	38	" There 's something sticking into my back , "
13005	13012	13014	13014	Susan	40	" And is n't it cold ? "
13016	13027	13029	13029	Peter	38	" Now that you mention it , it is cold , "
13031	13064	13029	13029	Peter	38	" and hang it all , it 's wet too . What 's the matter with this place ? I 'm sitting on something wet . It 's getting wetter every minute . "
13071	13077	13079	13079	Edmund	36	" Let 's get out , "
13081	13086	13079	13079	Edmund	36	" they 've gone . "
13087	13094	13096	13096	Susan	40	" O - o - oh ! "
13108	13116	13118	13118	Susan	40	" I 'm sitting against a tree , "
13120	13132	13118	13118	Susan	40	" and look ! It 's getting lighter -- over there . "
13133	13141	13143	13143	Peter	38	" By jove , you 're right , "
13145	13181	13143	13143	Peter	38	" and look there -- and there . It 's trees all round . And this wet stuff is snow . Why , I do believe we 've got into Lucy 's wood after all . "
13228	13236	13237	13237	he	38	" I apologise for not believing you , "
13240	13250	13237	13237	he	38	" I 'm sorry . Will you shake hands ? "
13251	13255	13257	13257	Lucy	60	" Of course , "
13262	13266	13268	13268	Susan	40	" And now , "
13270	13277	13268	13268	Susan	40	" what do we do next ? "
13278	13281	13283	13283	Peter	38	" Do ? "
13285	13297	13283	13283	Peter	38	" why , go and explore the wood , of course . "
13298	13301	13303	13303	Susan	40	" Ugh ! "
13309	13324	13303	13303	Susan	40	" it 's pretty cold . What about putting on some of these coats ? "
13325	13331	13333	13333	Peter	38	" They 're not ours , "
13336	13344	13346	13346	Susan	40	" I am sure nobody would mind , "
13348	13375	13346	13346	Susan	40	" It is n't as if we wanted to take them out of the house ; we sha n't take them even out of the wardrobe . "
13376	13385	13387	13387	Peter	38	" I never thought of that , Su , "
13389	13437	13387	13387	Peter	38	" Of course , now you put it that way , I see . No one could say you had bagged a coat as long as you leave it in the wardrobe where you found it . And I suppose this whole country is in the wardrobe . "
13507	13516	13518	13518	Lucy	60	" We can pretend we are Arctic explorers , "
13520	13532	13537	13537	he	38	" This is going to be exciting enough without any pretending , "
13566	13570	13572	13572	Edmund	36	" I say , "
13575	13602	13572	13572	Edmund	36	" ought n't we to be bearing a bit more to the left , that is , if we are aiming for the lamp - post . "
13651	13658	13659	13659	he	38	" So you really were here , "
13662	13683	13659	13659	he	38	" that time Lu said she 'd met you in here -- and you made out she was telling lies . "
13690	13699	13701	13701	Peter	38	" Well , of all the poisonous little beasts-- "
13735	13757	13729	13729	Edmund	36	" I 'll pay you all out for this , you pack of stuck - up , self - satisfied prigs . "
13758	13767	13769	13769	Susan	40	" Where _ are _ we going anyway ? "
13780	13790	13792	13792	Peter	38	" I think Lu ought to be the leader , "
13794	13809	13792	13792	Peter	38	" goodness knows she deserves it . Where will you take us , Lu ? "
13810	13819	13821	13821	Lucy	60	" What about going to see Mr. Tumnus ? "
13823	13834	13821	13821	Lucy	60	" He 's the nice Faun I told you about . "
14035	14045	14047	14047	Edmund	36	" This is a pretty good wash - out , "
14049	14056	14047	14047	Edmund	36	" not much good coming here . "
14057	14062	14064	14064	Peter	38	" What 's this ? "
14088	14096	14098	14098	Susan	40	" Is there anything written on it ? "
14100	14108	14110	14110	Peter	38	" Yes , I think there is , "
14112	14132	14110	14110	Peter	38	" but I ca n't read it in this light . Let 's get out into the open air . "
14151	14215	14133	14133	They	153	" The former occupant of these premises , the Faun Tumnus , is under arrest and awaiting his trial on a charge of High Treason against her Imperial Majesty Jadis , Queen of Narnia , Chatelaine of Cair Paravel , Empress of the Lone Islands , etc . , also of comforting her said Majesty 's enemies , harbouring spies and fraternising with Humans .
14233	14233	14230	14231	THE QUEEN	269	"
14241	14257	14259	14259	Susan	40	" I do n't know that I 'm going to like this place after all , "
14261	14269	14271	14271	Peter	38	" Who is this Queen , Lu ? "
14273	14281	14271	14271	Peter	38	" Do you know anything about her ? "
14282	14292	14294	14294	Lucy	60	" She is n't a real queen at all , "
14296	14337	14294	14294	Lucy	60	" she 's a horrible witch , the White Witch . Everyone -- all the wood people -- hate her . She has made an enchantment over the whole country so that it is always winter here and never Christmas . "
14338	14352	14354	14354	Susan	40	" I -- I wonder if there 's any point in going on , "
14356	14402	14354	14354	Susan	40	" I mean , it does n't seem particularly safe here and it looks as if it wo n't be much fun either . And it 's getting colder every minute , and we 've brought nothing to eat . What about just going home ? "
14403	14415	14417	14417	Lucy	60	" Oh , but we ca n't , we ca n't , "
14420	14490	14417	14417	Lucy	60	" Do n't you see ? We ca n't just go home , not after this . It is all on my account that the poor Faun has got into this trouble . He hid me from the Witch and showed me the way back . That 's what it means by comforting the Queen 's enemies and fraternising with Humans . We simply must try to rescue him . "
14491	14500	14502	14502	Edmund	36	" A lot _ we _ could do ! "
14504	14515	14502	14502	Edmund	36	" when we have n't even got anything to eat ! "
14516	14522	14524	14524	Peter	38	" Shut up -- you ! "
14534	14542	14524	14524	Peter	38	" What do you think , Susan ? "
14543	14554	14556	14556	Susan	40	" I 've a horrid feeling that Lu is right , "
14558	14599	14556	14556	Susan	40	" I do n't want to go a step further and I wish we 'd never come . But I think we must try to do something for Mr. Whatever - his - name is -- I mean the Faun . "
14600	14608	14610	14610	Peter	38	" That 's what I feel too , "
14612	14669	14610	14610	Peter	38	" I 'm worried about having no food with us . I 'd vote for going back and getting something from the larder , only there does n't seem to be any certainty of getting into this country again when once you 've got out of it . I think we 'll have to go on . "
14670	14675	14678	14679	the girls	139	" So do I , "
14681	14693	14695	14695	Peter	38	" If only we knew where the poor chap was imprisoned ! "
14712	14758	14709	14709	Lucy	60	" Look ! There 's a robin , with such a red breast . It 's the first bird I 've seen here . I say!--I wonder can birds talk in Narnia ? It almost looks as if it wanted to say something to us . "
14768	14784	14760	14760	she	60	" Please , can you tell us where Tumnus the Faun has been taken to ? "
14890	14895	14897	14897	Lucy	60	" Do you know , "
14899	14910	14897	14897	Lucy	60	" I really believe he means us to follow him . "
14911	14919	14921	14921	Susan	40	" I 've an idea he does , "
14923	14931	14921	14921	Susan	40	" what do you think , Peter ? "
14932	14942	14944	14944	Peter	38	" Well , we might as well try it , "
15055	15082	15050	15050	Edmund	36	" If you 're not still too high and mighty to talk to me , I 've something to say which you 'd better listen to . "
15083	15088	15090	15090	Peter	38	" What is it ? "
15092	15099	15101	15101	Edmund	36	" Hush ! Not so loud , "
15103	15121	15101	15101	Edmund	36	" there 's no good frightening the girls . But have you realised what we 're doing ? "
15122	15125	15127	15127	Peter	38	" What ? "
15136	15169	15101	15101	Edmund	36	" We 're following a guide we know nothing about . How do we know which side that bird is on ? Why should n't it be leading us into a trap ? "
15170	15210	15101	15101	Edmund	36	" That 's a nasty idea . Still -- a robin you know . They 're good birds in all the stories I 've ever read . I 'm sure a robin would n't be on the wrong side . "
15211	15270	15101	15101	Edmund	36	" If it comes to that , which _ is _ the right side ? How do we know that the fauns are in the right and the Queen ( yes , I know we 've been _ told _ she 's a witch ) is in the wrong ? We do n't really know anything about either . "
15271	15277	15101	15101	Edmund	36	" The Faun saved Lucy . "
15278	15311	15101	15101	Edmund	36	" He _ said _ he did . But how do we know ? And there 's another thing too . Has anyone the least idea of the way home from here ? "
15312	15316	15318	15318	Peter	38	" Great Scott ! "
15320	15328	15318	15318	Peter	38	" I had n't thought of that . "
15329	15337	15339	15339	Edmund	36	" And no chance of dinner either , "
15363	15366	15318	15318	Peter	38	" Oh ! "
15370	15374	15376	15376	Lucy	60	" The robin ! "
15378	15387	15376	15376	Lucy	60	" the robin . It 's flown away . "
15398	15407	15409	15409	Edmund	36	" And now what are we to do ? "
15422	15429	15409	15409	Edmund	36	" What did I tell you ? "
15430	15435	15437	15437	Susan	40	" Sh ! Look ! "
15439	15442	15444	15444	Peter	38	" What ? "
15446	15461	15409	15409	Edmund	36	" There 's something moving among the trees -- over there to the left . "
15478	15484	15486	15486	Susan	40	" There it goes again , "
15489	15497	15499	15499	Peter	38	" I saw it that time too , "
15501	15516	15499	15499	Peter	38	" It 's still there . It 's just gone behind that big tree . "
15517	15522	15524	15524	Lucy	60	" What is it ? "
15534	15539	15541	15541	Peter	38	" Whatever it is , "
15543	15560	15541	15541	Peter	38	" it 's dodging us . It 's something that does n't want to be seen . "
15561	15567	15569	15569	Susan	40	" Let 's go home , "
15605	15611	15613	15613	Lucy	60	" What 's it like ? "
15615	15625	15627	15627	Susan	40	" It's -- it 's a kind of animal , "
15632	15643	15627	15627	Susan	40	" Look ! Look ! Quick ! There it is . "
15743	15746	15721	15722	the stranger	407	" Hush , "
15771	15778	15780	15780	Peter	38	" I know what it is , "
15782	15793	15780	15780	Peter	38	" it 's a beaver . I saw the tail . "
15794	15803	15805	15805	Susan	40	" It wants us to go to it , "
15807	15819	15805	15805	Susan	40	" and it is warning us not to make a noise . "
15820	15824	15826	15826	Peter	38	" I know , "
15828	15848	15826	15826	Peter	38	" The question is are we to go to it or not ? What do you think , Lu ? "
15849	15858	15860	15860	Lucy	60	" I think it 's a nice beaver , "
15862	15873	15875	15875	Edmund	36	" Yes , but how do we _ know _ ? "
15877	15886	15888	15888	Susan	40	" Sha n't we have to risk it ? "
15890	15909	15888	15888	Susan	40	" I mean , it 's no good just standing here and I feel I want some dinner . "
15930	15934	15936	15936	Peter	38	" Come on , "
15938	15969	15936	15936	Peter	38	" let 's give it a try . All keep close together . We ought to be a match for one beaver if it turns out to be an enemy . "
16014	16034	15996	15997	the Beaver	71	" Further in , come further in . Right in here . We 're not safe in the open ! "
16085	16098	16124	16125	the Beaver	71	" Are you the Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve ? "
16102	16109	16111	16111	Peter	38	" We 're some of them , "
16113	16122	16124	16125	the Beaver	71	" S - s - s - sh ! "
16127	16140	16124	16125	the Beaver	71	" not so loud please . We 're not safe even here . "
16141	16150	16152	16152	Peter	38	" Why , who are you afraid of ? "
16154	16163	16152	16152	Peter	38	" There 's no one here but ourselves . "
16164	16170	16172	16173	the Beaver	71	" There are the trees , "
16175	16210	16172	16173	the Beaver	71	" They 're always listening . Most of them are on our side , but there _ are _ trees that would betray us to _ her _ ; you know who I mean , "
16219	16228	16230	16230	Edmund	36	" If it comes to talking about sides , "
16232	16242	16230	16230	Edmund	36	" how do we know you 're a friend ? "
16243	16253	16255	16255	Peter	38	" Not meaning to be rude , Mr. Beaver , "
16257	16266	16255	16255	Peter	38	" but you see , we 're strangers . "
16267	16274	16276	16277	the Beaver	71	" Quite right , quite right , "
16279	16285	16276	16277	the Beaver	71	" Here is my token . "
16312	16332	16309	16309	Lucy	60	" Oh , of course . It 's my handkerchief -- the one I gave to poor Mr. Tumnus . "
16333	16338	16340	16341	the Beaver	71	" That 's right , "
16343	16382	16340	16341	the Beaver	71	" Poor fellow , he got wind of the arrest before it actually happened and handed this over to me . He said that if anything happened to him I must meet you here and take you on to-- "
16434	16448	16463	16463	Aslan	72	" They say Aslan is on the move -- perhaps has already landed . "
16654	16661	16663	16663	Lucy	60	" And what about Mr. Tumnus , "
16665	16670	16663	16663	Lucy	60	" where is he ? "
16671	16680	16682	16683	the Beaver	71	" S - s - s - sh , "
16685	16704	16682	16683	the Beaver	71	" not here . I must bring you where we can have a real talk and also dinner . "
16730	16733	16734	16734	They	153	" dinner . "
16950	16956	16947	16947	Susan	40	" What a lovely dam ! "
16963	16965	16958	16959	Mr. Beaver	71	" Hush "
16969	16985	16958	16959	Mr. Beaver	71	" Merely a trifle ! Merely a trifle ! And it is n't really finished ! "
17282	17292	17295	17295	himself	36	" And I wonder how Peter will like that ? "
17305	17310	17312	17313	Mr. Beaver	71	" Here we are , "
17315	17341	17312	17313	Mr. Beaver	71	" and it looks as if Mrs. Beaver is expecting us . I 'll lead the way . But be careful and do n't slip . "
17447	17455	17457	17458	Mr. Beaver	71	" Here we are , Mrs. Beaver , "
17460	17475	17457	17458	Mr. Beaver	71	" I 've found them . Here are the Sons and Daughters of Adam and Eve"--and
17551	17559	17560	17560	she	60	" So you 've come at last ! "
17571	17611	17560	17560	she	60	" At last ! To think that ever I should live to see this day ! The potatoes are on boiling and the kettle 's singing and I daresay , Mr. Beaver , you 'll get us some fish . "
17612	17617	17619	17620	Mr. Beaver	71	" That I will , "
17979	17986	17975	17976	Mrs. Beaver	73	" Now we 're nearly ready . "
18259	18263	18265	18266	Mr. Beaver	71	" And now , "
18282	18314	18315	18315	he	71	" if you 'll just wait till I 've got my pipe lit up and going nicely -- why , now we can get to business . It 's snowing again , "
18325	18361	18315	18315	he	71	" That 's all the better , because it means we sha n't have any visitors ; and if anyone should have been trying to follow you , why he wo n't find any tracks . "
18370	18374	18376	18376	Lucy	60	" And now , "
18378	18390	18376	18376	Lucy	60	" do please tell us what 's happened to Mr. Tumnus . "
18391	18398	18403	18403	his	71	" Ah , that 's bad , "
18406	18439	18403	18403	his	71	" That 's a very , very bad business . There 's no doubt he was taken off by the police . I got that from a bird who saw it done . "
18440	18449	18451	18451	Lucy	60	" But where 's he been taken to ? "
18453	18473	18403	18403	his	71	" Well , they were heading northwards when they were last seen and we all know what that means . "
18474	18481	18483	18483	Susan	40	" No , we do n't , "
18497	18511	18513	18514	Mr. Beaver	71	" I 'm afraid it means they were taking him to her house , "
18516	18528	18530	18530	Lucy	60	" But what 'll they do to him , Mr. Beaver ? "
18532	18535	18537	18538	Mr. Beaver	71	" Well , "
18540	18590	18592	18592	he	71	" you ca n't exactly say for sure . But there 's not many taken in there that ever comes out again . Statues . All full of statues they say it is -- in the courtyard and up the stairs and in the hall . People she 's turned-- "
18597	18602	18592	18592	he	71	" turned into stone . "
18603	18609	18611	18611	Lucy	60	" But , Mr. Beaver , "
18613	18642	18611	18611	Lucy	60	" ca n't we -- I mean we _ must _ do something to save him . It 's too dreadful and it 's all on my account . "
18643	18658	18660	18661	Mrs. Beaver	73	" I do n't doubt you 'd save him if you could , dearie , "
18663	18683	18660	18661	Mrs. Beaver	73	" but you 've no chance of getting into that House against her will and ever coming out alive . "
18684	18692	18694	18694	Peter	38	" Could n't we have some stratagem ? "
18696	18774	18694	18694	Peter	38	" I mean could n't we dress up as something , or pretend to be -- oh , pedlars or anything -- or watch till she was gone out -- or -- oh , hang it all , there must be _ some _ way . This Faun saved my sister at his own risk , Mr. Beaver . We ca n't just leave him to be -- to be -- to have that done to him . "
18775	18785	18787	18788	Mr. Beaver	71	" It 's no good , Son of Adam , "
18790	18810	18787	18788	Mr. Beaver	71	" no good _ your _ trying , of all people . But now that Aslan is on the move-- "
18811	18821	18694	18694	Peter	38	" Oh , yes ! Tell us about Aslan ! "
18851	18856	18858	18858	Susan	40	" Who is Aslan ? "
18860	18863	18865	18866	Mr. Beaver	71	" Aslan ? "
18868	18949	18865	18866	Mr. Beaver	71	" Why do n't you know ? He 's the King . He 's the Lord of the whole wood , but not often here , you understand . Never in my time or my father 's time . But the word has reached us that he has come back . He is in Narnia at this moment . He 'll settle the White Queen all right . It is he , not you , that will save Mr. Tumnus . "
18950	18960	18962	18962	Edmund	36	" She wo n't turn him into stone too ? "
18964	18980	18982	18983	Mr. Beaver	71	" Lord love you , Son of Adam , what a simple thing to say ! "
18989	19046	18982	18983	Mr. Beaver	71	" Turn _ him _ into stone ? If she can stand on her two feet and look him in the face it 'll be the most she can do and more than I expect of her . No , no . He 'll put all to rights as it says in an old rhyme in these parts:--
19102	19102	19094	19094	You	481	"
19103	19110	19112	19112	Susan	40	" But shall we see him ? "
19114	19141	19143	19144	Mr. Beaver	71	" Why , Daughter of Eve , that 's what I brought you here for . I 'm to lead you where you shall meet him , "
19146	19154	19156	19156	Lucy	60	" Is -- is he a man ? "
19158	19163	19165	19166	Mr. Beaver	71	" Aslan a man ! "
19169	19219	19165	19166	Mr. Beaver	71	" Certainly not . I tell you he is the King of the wood and the son of the great Emperor - Beyond - the - Sea . Do n't you know who is the King of Beasts ? Aslan is a lion--_the _ Lion , the great Lion . "
19220	19223	19225	19225	Susan	40	" Ooh ! "
19227	19252	19225	19225	Susan	40	" I 'd thought he was a man . Is he -- quite safe ? I shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion . "
19253	19264	19266	19267	Mrs. Beaver	73	" That you will , dearie , and no mistake , "
19269	19295	19266	19267	Mrs. Beaver	73	" if there 's anyone who can appear before Aslan without their knees knocking , they 're either braver than most or else just silly . "
19296	19303	19305	19305	Lucy	60	" Then he is n't safe ? "
19307	19310	19312	19313	Mr. Beaver	71	" Safe ? "
19315	19353	19312	19313	Mr. Beaver	71	" Do n't you hear what Mrs. Beaver tells you ? Who said anything about safe ? ' Course he is n't safe . But he 's good . He 's the King , I tell you . "
19354	19362	19364	19364	Peter	38	" I 'm longing to see him , "
19366	19380	19364	19364	Peter	38	" even if I do feel frightened when it comes to the point . "
19381	19390	19392	19393	Mr. Beaver	71	" That 's right , Son of Adam , "
19413	19444	19395	19395	his	71	" And so you shall . Word has been sent that you _ are _ to meet him , to - morrow if you can , at the Stone Table . "
19445	19450	19452	19452	Lucy	60	" Where 's that ? "
19454	19460	19462	19463	Mr. Beaver	71	" I 'll show you , "
19465	19485	19462	19463	Mr. Beaver	71	" It 's down the river , a good step from here . I 'll take you to it ! "
19486	19495	19497	19497	Lucy	60	" But meanwhile what about poor Mr. Tumnus ? "
19499	19514	19516	19517	Mr. Beaver	71	" The quickest way you can help him is by going to meet Aslan , "
19519	19549	19516	19517	Mr. Beaver	71	" once he 's with us , then we can begin doing things . Not that we do n't need you too . For that 's another of the old rhymes:--
19622	19622	19696	19697	Mr. Beaver	71	"
19623	19635	19637	19637	Peter	38	" That 's what I do n't understand , Mr. Beaver , "
19639	19649	19637	19637	Peter	38	" I mean is n't the Witch herself human ? "
19650	19659	19661	19662	Mr. Beaver	71	" She 'd like us to believe it , "
19664	19693	19661	19662	Mr. Beaver	71	" and it 's on that that she bases her claim to be Queen . But she 's no Daughter of Eve . She comes of your father Adam's-- "
19700	19758	19661	19662	Mr. Beaver	71	" your father Adam 's first wife , her they called Lilith . And she was one of the Jinn . That 's what she comes from on one side . And on the other she comes of the giants . No , no , there is n't a drop of real Human blood in the Witch . "
19759	19772	19774	19775	Mrs. Beaver	73	" That 's why she 's bad all through , Mr. Beaver , "
19777	19784	19786	19786	he	71	" True enough , Mrs. Beaver , "
19788	19822	19786	19786	he	71	" there may be two views about Humans ( meaning no offence to the present company ) . But there 's no two views about things that look like Humans and are n't . "
19823	19830	19832	19833	Mrs. Beaver	73	" I 've known good dwarfs , "
19835	19847	19849	19850	her husband	486	" So've I , now you come to speak of it , "
19852	19965	19849	19850	her husband	486	" but precious few , and they were the ones least like men . But in general , take my advice , when you meet anything that 's going to be Human and is n't yet , or used to be Human once and is n't now , or ought to be Human and is n't , you keep your eyes on it and feel for your hatchet . And that 's why the Witch is always on the lookout for any Humans in Narnia . She 's been watching for you this many a year , and if she knew there were four of you she 'd be more dangerous still . "
19966	19975	19977	19977	Peter	38	" What 's that to do with it ? "
19979	19985	19987	19988	Mr. Beaver	71	" Because of another prophecy , "
19990	20119	19987	19988	Mr. Beaver	71	" Down at Cair Paravel -- that 's the castle on the sea coast down at the mouth of this river which ought to be the capital of the whole country if all was as it should be -- down at Cair Paravel there are four thrones and it 's a saying in Narnia time out of mind that when two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve sit in those four thrones , then it will be the end not only of the White Witch 's reign but of her life , and that is why we had to be so cautious as we came along , for if she knew about you four , your lives would n't be worth a shake of my whiskers ! "
20162	20170	20158	20158	Lucy	60	" I say -- where 's Edmund ? "
20182	20199	20179	20179	everyone	153	" Who saw him last ? How long has he been missing ? Is he outside ? "
20277	20282	20283	20283	they	487	" Edmund ! Edmund ! "
20310	20315	20317	20317	Susan	40	" How perfectly dreadful ! "
20327	20338	20317	20317	Susan	40	" Oh , how I wish we 'd never come . "
20339	20351	20353	20353	Peter	38	" What on earth are we to do , Mr. Beaver ? "
20355	20358	20360	20361	Mr. Beaver	71	" Do ? "
20371	20389	20360	20361	Mr. Beaver	71	" do ? We must be off at once . We have n't a moment to spare ! "
20390	20400	20402	20402	Peter	38	" We 'd better divide into four search parties , "
20404	20422	20402	20402	Peter	38	" and all go in different directions . Whoever finds him must come back here at once and-- "
20423	20431	20433	20434	Mr. Beaver	71	" Search parties , Son of Adam ? "
20436	20440	20433	20434	Mr. Beaver	71	" what for ? "
20441	20451	20360	20361	Mr. Beaver	71	" Why , to look for Edmund of course ! "
20452	20462	20464	20465	Mr. Beaver	71	" There 's no point in looking for him , "
20467	20473	20475	20475	Susan	40	" What do you mean ? "
20477	20509	20475	20475	Susan	40	" he ca n't be far away yet . And we 've got to find him . What do you mean when you say there 's no use looking for him ? "
20510	20519	20521	20522	Mr. Beaver	71	" The reason there 's no use looking , "
20524	20535	20521	20522	Mr. Beaver	71	" is that we know already where he 's gone ! "
20541	20547	20549	20550	Mr. Beaver	71	" Do n't you understand ? "
20552	20572	20549	20550	Mr. Beaver	71	" He 's gone to _ her _ , to the White Witch . He has betrayed us all . "
20573	20580	20582	20582	Susan	40	" Oh surely -- oh really ! "
20584	20592	20582	20582	Susan	40	" he ca n't have done that . "
20593	20598	20600	20601	Mr. Beaver	71	" Ca n't he ? "
20636	20644	20646	20646	Peter	38	" But will he know the way ? "
20648	20657	20659	20660	Mr. Beaver	71	" Has he been in this country before ? "
20662	20670	20659	20660	Mr. Beaver	71	" has he ever been here alone ? "
20671	20674	20676	20676	Lucy	60	" Yes , "
20682	20689	20676	20676	Lucy	60	" I 'm afraid he has . "
20690	20706	20659	20660	Mr. Beaver	71	" And did he tell you what he 'd done or who he 'd met ? "
20707	20716	20718	20718	Peter	38	" Well , no , he did n't , "
20720	20726	20728	20729	Mr. Beaver	71	" Then mark my words , "
20731	20821	20728	20729	Mr. Beaver	71	" he has already met the White Witch and joined her side , and been told where she lives . I did n't like to mention it before ( he being your brother and all ) but the moment I set eyes on that brother of yours I said to myself ' Treacherous . ' He had the look of one who has been with the Witch and eaten her food . You can always tell them if you 've lived long in Narnia , something about their eyes . "
20822	20827	20829	20829	Peter	38	" All the same , "
20838	20873	20829	20829	Peter	38	" we 'll still have to go and look for him . He is our brother after all , even if he is rather a little beast , and he 's only a kid . "
20874	20882	20884	20885	Mrs. Beaver	73	" Go to the Witch 's house ? "
20887	20909	20884	20885	Mrs. Beaver	73	" Do n't you see that the only chance of saving either him or yourselves is to keep away from her ? "
20910	20916	20918	20918	Lucy	60	" How do you mean ? "
20920	21019	20829	20829	Peter	38	" Why all she wants is to get all four of you ( she 's thinking all the time of those four thrones at Cair Paravel ) . Once you were all four inside her house her job would be done -- and there 'd be four new statues in her collection before you 'd had time to speak . But she 'll keep him alive as long as he 's the only one she 's got , because she 'll want to use him as a decoy ; as bait to catch the rest of you with . "
21020	21031	21033	21033	Lucy	60	" Oh , can _ no _ one help us ? "
21035	21039	21041	21042	Mr. Beaver	71	" Only Aslan , "
21044	21060	21041	21042	Mr. Beaver	71	" we must go on and meet him . That 's our only chance now . "
21061	21070	21072	21073	Mrs. Beaver	73	" It seems to me , my dears , "
21075	21161	21072	21073	Mrs. Beaver	73	" that it is very important to know just _ when _ he slipped away . How much he can tell her depends on how much he heard . For instance , had we started talking of Aslan before he left ? If not , then we may do very well , for she wo n't know that Aslan has come to Narnia , or that we are meeting him and will be quite off her guard as far as _ that _ is concerned . "
21162	21176	21178	21178	Peter	38	" I do n't remember his being here when we were talking about Aslan-- "
21185	21192	21193	21193	she	60	" Oh yes , he was , "
21197	21219	21193	21193	she	60	" do n't you remember , it was he who asked whether the Witch could n't turn Aslan into stone too ? "
21220	21228	21230	21230	Peter	38	" So he did , by Jove , "
21232	21244	21230	21230	Peter	38	" just the sort of thing he would say , too ! "
21245	21250	21252	21253	Mr. Beaver	71	" Worse and worse , "
21255	21282	21252	21253	Mr. Beaver	71	" and the next thing is this . Was he still here when I told you that the place for meeting Aslan was the Stone Table ? "
21295	21302	21304	21305	Mr. Beaver	71	" Because , if he was , "
21307	21343	21304	21305	Mr. Beaver	71	" then she 'll simply sledge down in that direction and get between us and the Stone Table and catch us on our way down . In fact we shall be cut off from Aslan . "
21344	21355	21357	21358	Mrs. Beaver	73	" But that is n't what she 'll do first , "
21360	21410	21357	21358	Mrs. Beaver	73	" not if I know her . The moment that Edmund tells her that we 're all here she 'll set out to catch us this very night , and if he 's been gone about half an hour , she 'll be here in about another twenty minutes . "
21411	21419	21421	21422	her husband	486	" You 're right , Mrs. Beaver , "
21424	21441	21421	21422	her husband	486	" we must all get away from here . There 's not a moment to lose . "
21816	21819	21820	21820	he	36	" Because , "
21825	21882	21820	21820	he	36	" all these people who say nasty things about her are her enemies and probably half of it is n't true . She was jolly nice to me , anyway , much nicer than they are . I expect she is the rightful Queen really . Anyway , she 'll be better than that awful Aslan ! "
22196	22217	22187	22187	he	36	" When I 'm King of Narnia the first thing I shall do will be to make some decent roads . "
22955	22963	22965	22965	Edmund	36	" But supposing it turns its head ? "
22993	22996	22998	22998	Edmund	36	" Aha ! "
23000	23015	22998	22998	Edmund	36	" When it springs at the dwarf then will be my chance to escape . "
23208	23211	23212	23212	he	36	" Probably , "
23215	23263	23212	23212	he	36	" this is the great Lion Aslan that they were all talking about . She 's caught him already and turned him into stone . So _ that 's _ the end of all their fine ideas about him ! Pooh ! Who 's afraid of Aslan ? "
23319	23344	23316	23316	he	36	" Yah ! Silly old Aslan ! How do you like being a stone ? You thought yourself mighty fine , did n't you ? "
23650	23661	23662	23662	he	36	" It 's all right , it 's all right , "
23668	23682	23662	23662	he	36	" it 's only a stone wolf . It ca n't hurt me , "
23721	23742	23646	23648	a great wolf	569	" Who 's there ? Who 's there ? Stand still , stranger , and tell me who you are . "
23743	23750	23752	23752	Edmund	36	" If you please , Sir , "
23762	23821	23752	23752	Edmund	36	" my name is Edmund , and I 'm the Son of Adam that Her Majesty met in the wood the other day and I 've come to bring her the news that my brother and sisters are now in Narnia -- quite close , in the Beavers ' house . She -- she wanted to see them . "
23822	23829	23831	23832	the Wolf	82	" I will tell Her Majesty , "
23834	23849	23831	23832	the Wolf	82	" Meanwhile , stand still on the threshold , as you value your life . "
23899	23918	23877	23879	the grey Wolf	571	" Come in ! Come in ! Fortunate favourite of the Queen -- or else not so fortunate . "
24008	24016	24018	24018	Edmund	36	" I 'm come , your Majesty , "
24023	24030	24032	24033	the Witch	1280	" How dare you come alone ? "
24039	24052	24032	24033	the Witch	1280	" Did I not tell you to bring the others with you ? "
24053	24059	24061	24061	Edmund	36	" Please , your Majesty , "
24063	24101	24061	24061	Edmund	36	" I 've done the best I can . I 've brought them quite close . They 're in the little house on top of the dam just up the river -- with Mr. and Mrs. Beaver . "
24113	24120	24121	24121	she	1280	" Is this all your news ? "
24124	24130	24132	24132	Edmund	36	" No , your Majesty , "
24150	24155	24157	24158	the Queen	269	" What ! Aslan ? "
24160	24175	24157	24158	the Queen	269	" Aslan ! Is this true ? If I find you have lied to me-- "
24176	24187	24189	24189	Edmund	36	" Please , I 'm only repeating what they said , "
24220	24226	24228	24229	the Witch	1280	" Make ready our sledge , "
24231	24239	24228	24229	the Witch	1280	" and use the harness without bells . "
24271	24278	24268	24269	Mr. Beaver	71	" There 's no time to lose "
24303	24351	24287	24288	Mrs. Beaver	73	" Now , Mr. Beaver , just reach down that ham . And here 's a packet of tea , and there 's sugar , and some matches . And if someone will get two or three loaves out of the crock over there in the corner . "
24352	24361	24363	24363	Susan	40	" What are you doing , Mrs. Beaver ? "
24365	24376	24378	24379	Mrs. Beaver	73	" Packing a load for each of us , dearie , "
24383	24403	24378	24379	Mrs. Beaver	73	" You did n't think we 'd set out on a journey with nothing to eat , did you ? "
24404	24411	24413	24413	Susan	40	" But we have n't time ! "
24422	24430	24413	24413	Susan	40	" She may be here any minute . "
24431	24438	24441	24442	Mr. Beaver	71	" That 's what I say , "
24444	24451	24453	24454	his wife	590	" Get along with you all , "
24456	24478	24453	24454	his wife	590	" Think it over , Mr. Beaver . She ca n't be here for a quarter of an hour at least . "
24479	24495	24497	24497	Peter	38	" But do n't we want as big a start as we can possibly get , "
24499	24511	24497	24497	Peter	38	" if we 're to reach the Stone Table before her ? "
24512	24525	24527	24527	Susan	40	" You 've got to remember _ that _ , Mrs. Beaver , "
24529	24551	24527	24527	Susan	40	" As soon as she has looked in here and finds we 're gone she 'll be off at top speed . "
24552	24557	24559	24560	Mrs. Beaver	73	" That she will , "
24562	24588	24559	24560	Mrs. Beaver	73	" But we ca n't get there before her whatever we do , for she 'll be on a sledge and we 'll be walking . "
24589	24597	24599	24599	Susan	40	" Then -- have we no hope ? "
24601	24614	24616	24617	Mrs. Beaver	73	" Now do n't you get fussing , there 's a dear , "
24619	24671	24616	24617	Mrs. Beaver	73	" but just get half a dozen clean handkerchiefs out of that drawer . ' Course we 've got a hope . We ca n't get there _ before _ her but we can keep under cover and go by ways she wo n't expect and perhaps we 'll get through . "
24672	24681	24683	24684	her husband	486	" That 's true enough , Mrs. Beaver , "
24686	24697	24683	24684	her husband	486	" But it 's time we were out of this . "
24698	24710	24712	24713	his wife	590	" And do n't you start fussing either , Mr. Beaver , "
24715	24742	24743	24743	she	590	" There . That 's better . There 's four loads and the smallest for the smallest of us : that 's you , my dear , "
24749	24757	24759	24759	Lucy	60	" Oh , do please come on , "
24761	24770	24772	24773	Mrs. Beaver	73	" Well , I 'm nearly ready now , "
24787	24799	24772	24773	Mrs. Beaver	73	" I suppose the sewing machine 's too heavy to bring ? "
24800	24808	24810	24811	Mr. Beaver	71	" Yes . It _ is _ , "
24813	24842	24810	24811	Mr. Beaver	71	" A great deal too heavy . And you do n't think you 'll be able to use it while we 're on the run , I suppose ? "
24843	24857	24859	24860	Mrs. Beaver	73	" I ca n't abide the thought of that Witch fiddling with it , "
24862	24875	24859	24860	Mrs. Beaver	73	" and breaking it or stealing it , as likely as not . "
24876	24888	24890	24892	the three children	495	" Oh , please , please , please , do hurry ! "
24909	24917	24918	24918	he	71	" It 'll delay her a bit , "
25031	25041	25042	25042	he	71	" Best keep down here as much as possible , "
25045	25065	25042	25042	he	71	" She 'll have to keep to the top , for you could n't bring a sledge down here . "
25360	25365	25367	25367	Peter	38	" Wherever is this ? "
25394	25408	25410	25411	Mr. Beaver	71	" It 's an old hiding - place for beavers in bad times , "
25413	25436	25410	25411	Mr. Beaver	71	" and a great secret . It 's not much of a place but we must get a few hours ' sleep . "
25437	25461	25463	25464	Mrs. Beaver	73	" If you had n't all been in such a plaguey fuss when we were starting , I 'd have brought some pillows , "
25843	25846	25848	25848	Lucy	60	" Oh , "
25850	25861	25848	25848	Lucy	60	" he 's been seen . She 's caught him ! "
25887	25893	25894	25894	he	71	" It 's all right , "
25898	25928	25894	25894	he	71	" Come out , Mrs. Beaver . Come out , Sons and Daughters of Adam and Eve . It 's all right ! It is n't _ her _ ! "
26006	26010	26012	26013	Mr. Beaver	71	" Come on ! "
26022	26046	26012	26013	Mr. Beaver	71	" Come and see ! This is a nasty knock for the Witch ! It looks as if her power was already crumbling . "
26047	26058	26060	26060	Peter	38	" What _ do _ you mean , Mr. Beaver ? "
26074	26081	26083	26084	Mr. Beaver	71	" Did n't I tell you , "
26086	26111	26083	26084	Mr. Beaver	71	" that she 'd made it always winter and never Christmas ? Did n't I tell you ? Well , just come and see ! "
26340	26347	26349	26349	he	629	" I 've come at last , "
26351	26383	26349	26349	he	629	" She has kept me out for a long time , but I have got in at last . Aslan is on the move . The Witch 's magic is weakening . "
26407	26411	26413	26414	Father Christmas	62	" And now , "
26416	26446	26413	26414	Father Christmas	62	" for your presents . There is a new and better sewing machine for you , Mrs. Beaver . I will drop it in your house as I pass . "
26447	26454	26456	26457	Mrs. Beaver	73	" If you please , sir , "
26463	26469	26456	26457	Mrs. Beaver	73	" It 's locked up . "
26470	26480	26482	26483	Father Christmas	62	" Locks and bolts make no difference to me , "
26485	26518	26482	26483	Father Christmas	62	" And as for you , Mr. Beaver , when you get home you will find your dam finished and mended and all the leaks stopped and a new sluice gate fitted . "
26542	26549	26551	26552	Father Christmas	62	" Peter , Adam 's Son , "
26554	26559	26561	26561	Peter	38	" Here , Sir , "
26563	26569	26601	26601	he	71	" These are your presents , "
26574	26597	26601	26601	he	71	" and they are tools not toys . The time to use them is perhaps near at hand . Bear them well . "
26699	26706	26708	26709	Father Christmas	62	" Susan , Eve 's Daughter , "
26711	26717	26719	26719	he	71	" These are for you , "
26736	26747	26748	26748	he	71	" You must use the bow only in great need , "
26751	26800	26748	26748	he	71	" for I do not mean you to fight in the battle . It does not easily miss . And when you put this horn to your lips and blow it , then , wherever you are , I think help of some kind will come to you . "
26807	26814	26804	26804	he	71	" Lucy , Eve 's Daughter , "
26848	26853	26854	26854	he	71	" In this bottle , "
26857	26923	26854	26854	he	71	" there is a cordial made of the juice of one of the fire - flowers that grow in the mountains of the sun . If you or any of your friends are hurt , a few drops of this will restore you . And the dagger is to defend yourself at great need . For you also are not to be in the battle . "
26924	26929	26931	26931	Lucy	60	" Why , Sir , "
26933	26951	26931	26931	Lucy	60	" I think -- I do n't know -- but I think I could be brave enough . "
26952	26959	26960	26960	he	71	" That is not the point , "
26963	26973	26974	26974	he	71	" But battles are ugly when women fight . And now"--here
26978	26988	26974	26974	he	71	grave--"here is something for the moment for you all ! "
27047	27058	27044	27044	he	71	" A Merry Christmas ! Long live the true King ! "
27107	27156	27103	27104	Mrs. Beaver	73	" Now then , now then ! Do n't stand talking there till the tea 's got cold . Just like men . Come and help to carry the tray down and we 'll have breakfast . What a mercy I thought of bringing the bread - knife . "
27206	27214	27202	27203	Mr. Beaver	71	" Time to be moving on now . "
27282	27300	27301	27301	she	1280	" Please , your Majesty , could I have some Turkish Delight ? You -- you -- said-- "
27304	27309	27301	27301	she	1280	" Silence , fool ! "
27325	27341	27311	27311	she	1280	" And yet it will not do to have the brat fainting on the way , "
27353	27362	27363	27363	she	1280	" Bring the human creature food and drink , "
27413	27427	27402	27402	he	263	" Turkish Delight for the little Prince . Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! "
27428	27433	27435	27435	Edmund	36	" Take it away , "
27438	27446	27435	27435	Edmund	36	" I do n't want dry bread . "
27485	27499	27501	27502	the Witch	1280	" You may be glad enough of it before you taste bread again , "
27590	27610	27612	27613	the Witch	1280	" Take with you the swiftest of your wolves and go at once to the house of the Beavers , "
27615	27696	27612	27613	the Witch	1280	" and kill whatever you find there . If they are already gone , then make all speed to the Stone Table , but do not be seen . Wait for me there in hiding . I meanwhile must go many miles to the West before I find a place where I can drive across the river . You may overtake these humans before they reach the Stone Table . You will know what to do if you find them ! "
27697	27706	27708	27709	the Wolf	664	" I hear and obey , O Queen , "
28126	28134	28122	28123	the Witch	1280	" What have we here ? Stop ! "
28346	28354	28356	28358	the Witch Queen	689	" What is the meaning of this ? "
28363	28368	28369	28369	she	689	" Speak , vermin ! "
28373	28413	28369	28369	she	689	" Or do you want my dwarf to find you a tongue with his whip ? What is the meaning of all this gluttony , this waste , this self indulgence ? Where did you get all these things ? "
28414	28420	28422	28423	the Fox	83	" Please , your Majesty , "
28425	28447	28422	28423	the Fox	83	" we were given them . And if I might make so bold as to drink your Majesty 's very good health-- "
28448	28455	28457	28458	the Witch	1280	" Who gave them to you ? "
28460	28470	28472	28473	the Fox	692	" F - F - F - Father Christmas , "
28475	28478	28480	28481	the Witch	1280	" What ? "
28498	28532	28480	28481	the Witch	1280	" He has not been here ! He can not have been here ! How dare you -- but no . Say you have been lying and you shall even now be forgiven . "
28546	28556	28587	28587	she	1280	" He has -- he has -- he has ! "
28592	28604	28606	28606	Edmund	36	" Oh do n't , do n't , please do n't , "
28666	28671	28673	28674	the Witch	1280	" As for you , "
28692	28708	28673	28674	the Witch	1280	" let that teach you to ask favour for spies and traitors . Drive on ! "
29159	29172	29155	29156	the Witch	1280	" Do n't sit staring , fool ! Get out and help . "
29316	29325	29327	29328	the Dwarf	263	" It 's no good , your Majesty , "
29330	29339	29327	29328	the Dwarf	263	" We ca n't sledge in this thaw . "
29340	29346	29348	29349	the Witch	59	" Then we must walk , "
29351	29359	29361	29362	the dwarf	263	" We shall never overtake them walking , "
29364	29373	29361	29362	the dwarf	263	" Not with the start they 've got . "
29374	29383	29385	29386	the Witch	1280	" Are you my councillor or my slave ? "
29388	29435	29385	29386	the Witch	1280	" Do as you 're told . Tie the hands of the human creature behind it and keep hold of the end of the rope . And take your whip . And cut the harness of the reindeer ; they 'll find their own way home . "
29507	29512	29496	29497	The Witch	1280	" Faster ! Faster ! "
29668	29674	29676	29677	the Dwarf	263	" Mind your own business ! "
29846	29851	29853	29854	the Witch	1280	" Faster ! Faster ! "
29974	29980	29982	29983	the Dwarf	263	" This is no thaw , "
29988	30017	29982	29983	the Dwarf	263	" This is _ spring _ . What are we to do ? Your winter has been destroyed , I tell you ! This is Aslan 's doing . "
30018	30028	30030	30031	the Witch	1280	" If either of you mention that name again , "
30033	30040	30030	30031	the Witch	1280	" he shall instantly be killed . "
30102	30110	30093	30093	they	726	" Look ! There 's a kingfisher ! "
30112	30118	30093	30093	they	726	" I say , bluebells ! "
30120	30127	30093	30093	they	726	" What was that lovely smell ? "
30129	30136	30093	30093	they	726	" Just listen to that thrush ! "
30510	30515	30517	30518	Mr. Beaver	71	" Not long now , "
30652	30656	30658	30658	Peter	38	" By gum ! "
30662	30666	30658	30658	Peter	38	" The sea ! "
31100	31104	31106	31107	Mr. Beaver	71	" Go on , "
31109	31112	31114	31114	Peter	38	" No , "
31116	31120	31114	31114	Peter	38	" you first . "
31121	31130	31132	31133	Mr. Beaver	71	" No , Sons of Adam before animals , "
31137	31140	31142	31142	Peter	38	" Susan , "
31144	31152	31142	31142	Peter	38	" what about you ? Ladies first . "
31153	31161	31163	31163	Susan	40	" No , you 're the eldest , "
31209	31217	31218	31218	he	38	" Come on . Pull yourselves together , "
31226	31233	31218	31218	he	38	" We have come -- Aslan . "
31234	31243	31245	31245	Aslan	72	" Welcome , Peter , Son of Adam , "
31247	31267	31245	31245	Aslan	72	" Welcome , Susan and Lucy , Daughters of Eve . Welcome He - Beaver and She - Beaver . "
31303	31310	31312	31312	Aslan	72	" But where is the fourth ? "
31314	31330	31332	31333	Mr. Beaver	71	" He has tried to betray them and joined the White Witch , O Aslan , "
31342	31366	31339	31339	Peter	38	" That was partly my fault , Aslan . I was angry with him and I think that helped him to go wrong . "
31406	31411	31413	31413	Lucy	60	" Please -- Aslan , "
31415	31424	31413	31413	Lucy	60	" can anything be done to save Edmund ? "
31425	31431	31433	31433	Aslan	72	" All shall be done , "
31435	31445	31433	31433	Aslan	72	" But it may be harder than you think . "
31508	31512	31514	31514	Lucy	60	" Terrible paws , "
31516	31527	31514	31514	Lucy	60	" If he did n't know how to velvet them ! "
31532	31556	31497	31498	The Lion	72	" Meanwhile , let the feast be prepared . Ladies , take these Daughters of Eve to the pavilion and minister to them . "
31584	31611	31562	31562	Aslan	72	" Come , Son of Adam , and I will show you a far - off sight of the castle where you are to be King . "
31796	31802	31804	31804	Aslan	72	" That , O Man , "
31806	31848	31804	31804	Aslan	72	" is Cair Paravel of the four thrones , in one of which you must sit as King . I show it to you because you are the first - born and you will be High King over all the rest . "
31877	31885	31887	31887	Aslan	72	" It is your sister 's horn , "
31946	31956	31957	31957	he	72	" Back ! Let the Prince win his spurs , "
32463	32468	32473	32473	Aslan	72	" Quick ! Quick ! "
32475	32530	32473	32473	Aslan	72	" Centaurs ! Eagles ! I see another wolf in the thickets . There -- behind you . He has just darted away . After him , all of you ! He will be going to his mistress . Now is your chance to find the Witch and rescue the fourth Son of Adam . "
32572	32581	32583	32583	Aslan	72	" You have forgotten to clean your sword , "
32633	32645	32647	32647	Aslan	72	" Hand it to me and kneel , Son of Adam , "
32667	32689	32655	32655	he	38	" Rise up , Sir Peter Fenris - Bane . And , whatever happens , never forget to wipe your sword . "
32808	32811	32813	32814	the Dwarf	263	" No , "
32816	32836	32813	32814	the Dwarf	263	" it is no use now , O Queen . They must have reached the Stone Table by now . "
32837	32850	32852	32853	the Witch	1280	" Perhaps the Wolf will smell us out and bring us news , "
32855	32866	32868	32869	the Dwarf	263	" It can not be good news if he does , "
32871	32878	32880	32881	the Witch	1280	" Four thrones in Cair Paravel , "
32883	32898	32880	32881	the Witch	1280	" How if only three were filled ? That would not fulfil the prophecy . "
32899	32913	32915	32916	the Dwarf	263	" What difference would that make now that _ he _ is here ? "
32936	32955	32880	32881	the Witch	1280	" He may not stay long . And then -- we would fall upon the three at Cair . "
32956	32963	32965	32966	the Dwarf	263	" Yet it might be better , "
32968	32973	32976	32976	he	263	" to keep this one "
32980	32985	32976	32976	he	263	" for bargaining with . "
32986	32994	32996	32997	the Witch	1280	" Yes ! And have him rescued , "
33000	33003	33005	33006	the Dwarf	263	" Then , "
33008	33021	33005	33006	the Dwarf	263	" we had better do what we have to do at once . "
33022	33036	33038	33039	the Witch	1280	" I would like to have done it on the Stone Table itself , "
33041	33058	33038	33039	the Witch	1280	" That is the proper place . That is where it has always been done before . "
33059	33080	33082	33083	the Dwarf	263	" It will be a long time now before the Stone Table can again be put to its proper use , "
33085	33088	33090	33091	the Witch	1280	" True , "
33096	33103	33090	33091	the Witch	1280	" Well , I will begin . "
33120	33172	33113	33114	a Wolf	816	" I have seen them . They are all at the Stone Table , with _ him _ . They have killed my captain , Fenris Ulf . I was hidden in the thickets and saw it all . One of the Sons of Adam killed him . Fly ! Fly ! "
33173	33176	33178	33179	the Witch	1280	" No , "
33181	33298	33178	33179	the Witch	1280	" There need be no flying . Go quickly . Summon all our people to meet me here as speedily as they can . Call out the giants and the werewolves and the spirits of those trees who are on our side . Call the Ghouls , and the Boggles , the Ogres and the Minotaurs . Call the Cruels , the Hags , the Spectres , and the people of the Toadstools . We will fight . What ? Have I not still my wand ? Will not their ranks turn into stone even as they come on ? Be off quickly , I have a little thing to finish here while you are away . "
33312	33315	33317	33317	she	820	" Now ! "
33319	33341	33317	33317	she	820	" we have no table -- let me see . We had better put it against the trunk of a tree . "
33413	33418	33420	33421	the Witch	1280	" Prepare the victim , "
33555	33580	33600	33600	they	827	" Let him lie down -- give him some wine -- drink this -- steady now -- you'll be all right in a minute . "
33605	33666	33600	33600	they	827	" Who 's got the Witch?--I thought you had her -- I did n't see her after I knocked the knife out of her hand -- I was after the Dwarf -- Do you mean to say she 's escaped?--A chap ca n't mind everything at once -- What 's that ? Oh sorry it 's only an old stump ! "
34068	34074	34075	34075	he	72	" Here is your brother , "
34078	34094	34075	34075	he	72	" and -- there is no need to talk to him about what is past . "
34112	34117	34095	34095	Edmund	36	" I 'm sorry , "
34121	34127	34119	34119	everyone	153	" That 's all right . "
34190	34204	34183	34184	the leopards	851	" Sire , there is a messenger from the enemy who craves audience . "
34205	34210	34212	34212	Aslan	72	" Let him approach , "
34227	34237	34239	34239	Aslan	72	" What is your message , Son of Earth ? "
34241	34263	34265	34266	the Dwarf	263	" The Queen of Narnia and Empress of the Lone Islands desires a safe conduct to come and speak with you , "
34268	34283	34265	34266	the Dwarf	263	" on a matter which is as much to your advantage as to hers . "
34284	34291	34293	34294	Mr. Beaver	71	" Queen of Narnia , indeed ! "
34296	34301	34293	34294	Mr. Beaver	71	" Of all the cheek-- "
34302	34307	34309	34309	Aslan	72	" Peace , Beaver , "
34311	34361	34309	34309	Aslan	72	" All names will soon be restored to their proper owners . In the meantime we will not dispute about noises . Tell your mistress , Son of Earth , that I grant her safe conduct on condition that she leaves her wand behind her at that great oak . "
34384	34395	34397	34397	Lucy	60	" But supposing she turns the two leopards into stone ? "
34447	34454	34456	34456	Peter	38	" It 'll be all right , "
34460	34471	34456	34456	Peter	38	" He would n't send them if it were n't . "
34604	34613	34615	34616	the Witch	1280	" You have a traitor there , Aslan , "
34671	34674	34676	34676	Aslan	72	" Well , "
34678	34686	34676	34676	Aslan	72	" His offence was not against you . "
34687	34695	34697	34698	the Witch	59	" Have you forgotten the Deep Magic ? "
34700	34709	34711	34711	Aslan	72	" Let us say I have forgotten it , "
34714	34722	34711	34711	Aslan	72	" Tell us of this Deep Magic . "
34723	34727	34729	34730	the Witch	1280	" Tell you ? "
34738	34837	34732	34732	her	1280	" Tell you what is written on that very Table of Stone which stands beside us ? Tell you what is written in letters deep as a spear is long on the trunk of the World Ash Tree ? Tell you what is engraved on the sceptre of the Emperor - Beyond - the - Sea ? You at least know the magic which the Emperor put into Narnia at the very beginning . You know that every traitor belongs to me as my lawful prey and that for every treachery I have a right to a kill . "
34838	34841	34843	34844	Mr. Beaver	71	" Oh , "
34846	34872	34843	34844	Mr. Beaver	71	" So _ that 's _ how you came to imagine yourself a Queen -- because you were the Emperor 's hangman . I see . "
34873	34878	34880	34880	Aslan	72	" Peace , Beaver , "
34888	34892	34894	34895	the Witch	1280	" And so , "
34897	34917	34894	34895	the Witch	1280	" that human creature is mine . His life is forfeit to me . His blood is my property . "
34918	34925	34927	34931	the Bull with the man	872	" Come and take it then , "
34940	34943	34945	34946	the Witch	1280	" Fool , "
34957	35006	34945	34946	the Witch	1280	" do you really think your master can rob me of my rights by mere force ? He knows the Deep Magic better than that . He knows that unless I have blood as the Law says all Narnia will be overturned and perish in fire and water . "
35007	35013	35015	35015	Aslan	72	" It is very true , "
35017	35024	35015	35015	Aslan	72	" I do not deny it . "
35025	35030	35032	35032	Susan	40	" Oh , Aslan ! "
35039	35074	35032	35032	Susan	40	" ca n't we -- I mean , you wo n't , will you ? Ca n't we do something about the Deep Magic ? Is n't there something you can work against it ? "
35075	35083	35085	35085	Aslan	72	" Work against the Emperor 's magic ? "
35165	35173	35175	35175	Aslan	72	" Fall back , all of you , "
35177	35187	35175	35175	Aslan	72	" and I will talk to the Witch alone . "
35218	35223	35215	35215	Lucy	60	" Oh , Edmund ! "
35326	35333	35334	35334	he	72	" You can all come back , "
35337	35355	35334	35334	he	72	" I have settled the matter . She has renounced the claim on your brother 's blood . "
35418	35430	35413	35413	she	1280	" But how do I know this promise will be kept ? "
35431	35434	35436	35436	Aslan	72	" Wow ! "
35504	35534	35501	35501	Aslan	72	" We must move from this place at once , it will be wanted for other purposes . We shall encamp to - night at the Fords of Beruna . "
35667	35680	35681	35681	he	72	" As soon as she has finished her business in these parts , "
35684	35722	35681	35681	he	72	" the Witch and her crew will almost certainly fall back to her house and prepare for a siege . You may or may not be able to cut her off and prevent her from reaching it . "
35770	35782	35756	35756	he	72	" You must put your centaurs in such and such a place "
35784	35802	35756	35756	he	72	" You must post scouts to see that she does n't do so - and - so , "
35809	35819	35806	35806	Peter	38	" But you will be there yourself , Aslan . "
35820	35830	35832	35833	the Lion	771	" I can give you no promise of that , "
35924	35948	35921	35921	Peter	38	" Would n't it be better to camp on the far side -- for fear she should try a night attack or anything ? "
35971	35978	35960	35960	himself	72	" Eh ? What 's that ? "
35986	35989	35991	35991	Aslan	72	" No , "
36004	36017	35991	35991	Aslan	72	" No . She will not make an attack to - night . "
36029	36055	36026	36026	he	72	" All the same it was well thought of . That is how a soldier ought to think . But it does n't really matter . "
36194	36203	36205	36205	Susan	40	" Ca n't you get to sleep either ? "
36207	36210	36212	36212	Lucy	60	" No , "
36214	36226	36212	36212	Lucy	60	" I thought you were asleep . I say , Susan ? "
36227	36230	36179	36179	Lucy	60	" What ? "
36231	36247	36212	36212	Lucy	60	" I 've a most horrible feeling -- as if something were hanging over us . "
36248	36263	36179	36179	Lucy	60	" Have you ? Because , as a matter of fact , so have I. "
36264	36269	36271	36271	Lucy	60	" Something about Aslan , "
36273	36296	36271	36271	Lucy	60	" Either some dreadful thing that is going to happen to him , or something dreadful that he 's going to do . "
36297	36308	36310	36310	Susan	40	" There 's been something wrong with him all afternoon , "
36312	36348	36310	36310	Susan	40	" Lucy ! What was that he said about not being with us at the battle ? You do n't think he could be stealing away and leaving us to - night , do you ? "
36349	36355	36357	36357	Lucy	60	" Where is he now ? "
36359	36367	36357	36357	Lucy	60	" Is he here in the pavilion ? "
36368	36375	36310	36310	Susan	40	" I do n't think so . "
36376	36394	36357	36357	Lucy	60	" Susan ! Let 's go outside and have a look round . We might see him . "
36395	36402	36404	36404	Susan	40	" All right . Let 's , "
36406	36420	36404	36404	Susan	40	" we might just as well be doing that as lying awake here . "
36471	36474	36462	36462	Susan	40	" Look ! "
36655	36668	36652	36652	he	917	" Oh , children , children , why are you following me ? "
36669	36675	36677	36677	Lucy	60	" We could n't sleep , "
36699	36713	36715	36715	Susan	40	" Please , may we come with you -- wherever you 're going ? "
36717	36719	36721	36721	Aslan	72	" Well-- "
36732	36770	36729	36729	he	72	" I should be glad of company to - night . Yes , you may come , if you will promise to stop when I tell you , and after that leave me to go on alone . "
36771	36784	36786	36788	the two girls	355	" Oh , thank you , thank you . And we will , "
36838	36844	36846	36846	Lucy	60	" Aslan ! Dear Aslan ! "
36848	36859	36846	36846	Lucy	60	" what is wrong ? Ca n't you tell us ? "
36860	36868	36870	36870	Susan	40	" Are you ill , dear Aslan ? "
36872	36875	36877	36877	Aslan	95	" No , "
36879	36907	36877	36877	Aslan	95	" I am sad and lonely . Lay your hands on my mane so that I can feel you are there and let us walk like that . "
37020	37045	37015	37015	Aslan	95	" Oh , children , children . Here you must stop . And whatever happens , do not let yourselves be seen . Farewell . "
37311	37315	37316	37316	she	1280	" The fool ! "
37319	37329	37316	37316	she	1280	" The fool has come . Bind him fast . "
37382	37389	37391	37393	the White Witch	1261	" Bind him , I say ! "
37519	37522	37524	37525	the Witch	1280	" Stop ! "
37527	37534	37524	37525	the Witch	1280	" Let him first be shaved . "
37621	37633	37635	37635	one	1408	" Why , he 's only a great cat after all ! "
37637	37648	37653	37653	they	947	" Is _ that _ what we were afraid of ? "
37664	37672	37653	37653	they	947	" Puss , Puss ! Poor Pussy , "
37674	37687	37653	37653	they	947	" How many mice have you caught to - day , Cat ? "
37689	37700	37653	37653	they	947	" Would you like a saucer of milk , Pussums ? "
37701	37709	37711	37711	Lucy	60	" Oh how _ can _ they ? "
37719	37726	37711	37711	Lucy	60	" The brutes , the brutes ! "
37755	37759	37761	37762	the Witch	1280	" Muzzle him ! "
37939	37946	37948	37948	Susan	40	" The cowards ! The cowards ! "
37950	37963	37948	37948	Susan	40	" Are they _ still _ afraid of him , even now ? "
38139	38242	38129	38129	she	1280	" And now , who has won ? Fool , did you think that by all this you would save the human traitor ? Now I will kill you instead of him as our pact was and so the Deep Magic will be appeased . But when you are dead what will prevent me from killing him as well ? And who will take him out of my hand _ then _ ? Understand that you have given me Narnia forever , you have lost your own life and you have not saved his . In that knowledge , despair and die . "
38307	38351	38302	38303	the Witch	1280	" Now ! Follow me all and we will set about what remains of this war ! It will not take us long to crush the human vermin and the traitors now that the great Fool , the great Cat , lies dead . "
38601	38621	38598	38598	Lucy	60	" I ca n't bear the look of that horrible muzzle . I wonder could we take it off ? "
38704	38714	38716	38716	Susan	40	" I wonder could we untie him as well ? "
38967	38970	38972	38972	Susan	40	" Ugh ! "
38981	39001	38972	38972	Susan	40	" How beastly ! There are horrid little mice crawling over him . Go away , you little beasts . "
39012	39015	39017	39017	Lucy	60	" Wait ! "
39028	39037	39017	39017	Lucy	60	" Can you see what they 're doing ? "
39045	39050	39052	39052	Susan	40	" I do believe ! "
39054	39067	39052	39052	Susan	40	" But how queer . They 're nibbling away at the cords ! "
39068	39075	39077	39077	Lucy	60	" That 's what I thought , "
39079	39109	39077	39077	Lucy	60	" I think they 're friendly mice . Poor little things -- they do n't realise he 's dead . They think it 'll do some good untying him . "
39306	39312	39314	39314	Lucy	60	" I 'm so cold , "
39316	39321	39323	39323	Susan	40	" So am I , "
39325	39333	39323	39323	Susan	40	" Let 's walk about a bit . "
39501	39506	39508	39508	Lucy	60	" What 's that ? "
39515	39525	39527	39527	Susan	40	" I -- I feel afraid to turn round , "
39529	39535	39527	39527	Susan	40	" something awful is happening . "
39536	39547	39549	39549	Lucy	60	" They 're doing something worse to _ him _ , "
39551	39555	39557	39557	she	60	" Come on ! "
39629	39636	39638	39640	the two girls	355	" Oh , oh , oh ! "
39647	39657	39659	39659	Lucy	60	" Oh , it 's _ too _ bad , "
39661	39670	39659	39659	Lucy	60	" they might have left the body alone . "
39671	39677	39679	39679	Susan	40	" Who 's done it ? "
39681	39692	39679	39679	Susan	40	" What does it mean ? Is it more magic ? "
39693	39696	39659	39659	Lucy	60	" Yes ! "
39705	39711	39659	39659	Lucy	60	" It is more magic . "
39746	39751	39754	39755	the children	391	" Oh , Aslan ! "
39771	39781	39783	39783	Lucy	60	" Are n't you dead then , dear Aslan ? "
39785	39789	39791	39791	Aslan	72	" Not now , "
39793	39801	39803	39803	Susan	40	" You 're not -- not a-- ? "
39855	39861	39862	39862	he	72	" Do I look it ? "
39865	39880	39882	39882	Lucy	60	" Oh , you 're real , you 're real ! Oh , Aslan ! "
39896	39904	39906	39906	Susan	40	" But what does it all mean ? "
39913	39917	39919	39919	Aslan	72	" It means , "
39921	40019	39919	39919	Aslan	72	" that though the Witch knew the Deep Magic , there is a magic deeper still which she did not know . Her knowledge goes back only to the dawn of Time . But if she could have looked a little further back , into the stillness and the darkness before Time dawned , she would have read there a different incantation . She would have known that when a willing victim who had committed no treachery was killed in a traitor 's stead , the Table would crack and Death itself would start working backwards . And now--
40020	40026	40028	40028	Lucy	60	" Oh yes . Now ? "
40036	40041	40043	40044	the Lion	771	" Oh , children , "
40046	40066	40067	40067	He	72	" I feel my strength coming back to me . Oh , children , catch me if you can ! "
40275	40279	40281	40281	Aslan	72	" And now , "
40284	40306	40281	40281	Aslan	72	" to business . I feel I am going to roar . You had better put your fingers in your ears . "
40369	40384	40366	40366	he	72	" We have a long journey to go . You must ride on me . "
40830	40836	40837	40837	he	72	" The Witch 's home ! "
40840	40848	40837	40837	he	72	" Now , children , hold tight . "
40945	40951	40953	40953	Lucy	60	" What an extraordinary place ! "
40955	40973	40953	40953	Lucy	60	" All those stone animals -- and people too ! It's -- it 's like a museum . "
40974	40977	40979	40979	Susan	40	" Hush , "
40981	40987	40979	40979	Susan	40	" Aslan 's doing something . "
41095	41107	41092	41092	Lucy	60	" Oh , Susan ! Look ! Look at the lion . "
41511	41514	41516	41516	Susan	40	" Ooh ! "
41522	41535	41516	41516	Susan	40	" Look ! I wonder -- I mean , is it safe ? "
41553	41559	41561	41561	Aslan	72	" It 's all right ! "
41564	41580	41561	41561	Aslan	72	" Once the feet are put right , all the rest of him will follow . "
41581	41590	41592	41592	Susan	40	" That was n't exactly what I meant , "
41651	41685	41637	41637	he	72	" Bless me ! I must have been asleep . Now ! Where 's that dratted little Witch that was running about on the ground . Somewhere just by my feet it was . "
41804	41813	41815	41815	Aslan	72	" Now for the inside of this house ! "
41817	41851	41815	41815	Aslan	72	" Look alive , everyone . Up stairs and down stairs and in my lady 's chamber ! Leave no corner unsearched . You never know where some poor prisoner may be concealed . "
41889	41952	41882	41882	everyone	153	" Do n't forget the dungeons -- Give us a hand with this door!--Here 's another little winding stair -- Oh ! I say . Here 's a poor little kangaroo . Call Aslan -- Phew ! How it smells in here -- Look out for trap - doors -- Up here ! There are a whole lot more on the landing ! "
41967	41984	41960	41960	Lucy	60	" Aslan ! Aslan ! I 've found Mr. Tumnus . Oh , do come quick . "
42108	42118	42098	42098	someone	302	" But how are we going to get out ? "
42134	42141	42143	42143	Aslan	72	" That 'll be all right , "
42162	42169	42170	42170	he	72	" Hi ! You up there , "
42173	42179	42170	42170	he	72	" What 's your name ? "
42180	42189	42191	42192	the Giant	1051	" Giant Rumblebuffin if it please your honour , "
42200	42207	42209	42209	Aslan	72	" Well then , Giant Rumblebuffin , "
42211	42222	42209	42209	Aslan	72	" just let us out of this , will you ? "
42223	42235	42237	42238	Giant Rumblebuffin	103	" Certainly , your honour . It will be a pleasure , "
42240	42254	42237	42238	Giant Rumblebuffin	103	" Stand well away from the gates , all you little ' uns . "
42384	42396	42398	42405	the Giant puffing like the largest railway engine	1079	" Blowed if I ai n't all in a muck sweat , "
42407	42434	42398	42405	the Giant puffing like the largest railway engine	1079	" Comes of being out of condition . I suppose neither of you young ladies has such a thing as a pocket - handkerchee about you ? "
42435	42441	42443	42443	Lucy	60	" Yes , I have , "
42461	42467	42469	42470	Giant Rumblebuffin	103	" Thank you , Missie , "
42522	42549	42508	42508	he	103	" Bless me ! I 've picked up the little girl instead . I beg your pardon , Missie , I thought you was the handkerchee ! "
42550	42555	42557	42557	Lucy	60	" No , no , "
42560	42565	42557	42557	Lucy	60	" here it is ! "
42613	42628	42610	42610	she	60	" I 'm afraid it 's not much use to you , Mr. Rumblebuffin . "
42629	42638	42640	42641	the Giant	1051	" Not at all . Not at all , "
42644	42668	42640	42641	the Giant	1051	" Never met a nicer handkerchee . So fine , so handy . So -- I do n't know how to describe it . "
42669	42677	42679	42679	Lucy	60	" What a nice giant he is ! "
42684	42688	42690	42691	the Faun	179	" Oh yes , "
42693	42754	42690	42691	the Faun	179	" All the Buffins always were . One of the most respected of all the giant families in Narnia . Not very clever , perhaps ( I never knew a giant that was ) but an old family . With traditions , you know . If he 'd been the other sort she 'd never have turned him into stone . "
42768	42778	42779	42779	he	72	" Our day 's work is not yet over , "
42782	42804	42779	42779	he	72	" and if the Witch is to be finally defeated before bed - time we must find the battle at once . "
42805	42814	42816	42820	the largest of the centaurs	1083	" And join in I hope , Sir ! "
42822	42826	42828	42828	Aslan	72	" Of course , "
42830	42906	42828	42828	Aslan	72	" And now ! Those who ca n't keep up -- that is , children , dwarfs , and small animals -- must ride on the backs of those who can -- that is , lions , centaurs , unicorns , horses , giants and eagles . Those who are good with their noses must come in the front with us lions to smell out where the battle is . Look lively and sort yourselves . "
42951	43004	43007	43007	he	1086	" Did you hear what he said ? _ Us lions _ . That means him and me . _ Us lions _ . That 's what I like about Aslan . No side , no stand - off - ishness . _ Us lions _ . That meant him and me . "
43469	43476	43478	43478	Aslan	72	" Off my back , children , "
43750	43760	43761	43761	Peter	38	" It was all Edmund 's doing , Aslan , "
43765	43899	43761	43761	Peter	38	" We 'd have been beaten if it had n't been for him . The Witch was - turning our troops into stone right and left . But nothing would stop him . He fought his way through three ogres to where she was just turning one of your leopards into a statue . And when he reached her he had the sense to bring his sword smashing down on her wand instead of trying to go for her directly and simply getting made a statue himself for his pains . That was the mistake all the rest were making . Once her wand was broken we began to have some chance -- if we had n't lost so many already . He was terribly wounded . We must go and see him . "
43936	43941	43943	43943	Aslan	72	" Quick , Lucy , "
44000	44007	44009	44009	Aslan	72	" There are other people wounded , "
44031	44037	44039	44039	Lucy	60	" Yes , I know , "
44042	44047	44039	44039	Lucy	60	" Wait a minute . "
44048	44053	44055	44055	Aslan	72	" Daughter of Eve , "
44061	44078	44055	44055	Aslan	72	" others also are at the point of death . Must more people die for Edmund ? "
44079	44086	44088	44088	Lucy	60	" I 'm sorry , Aslan , "
44212	44217	44219	44219	Lucy	60	" Does he know , "
44223	44242	44219	44219	Lucy	60	" what Aslan did for him ? Does he know what the arrangement with the Witch really was ? "
44243	44252	44254	44254	Susan	40	" Hush ! No . Of course not , "
44256	44264	44266	44266	Lucy	60	" Ought n't he to be told ? "
44268	44274	44276	44276	Susan	40	" Oh , surely not , "
44278	44297	44276	44276	Susan	40	" It would be too awful for him . Think how you 'd feel if you were he . "
44298	44309	44311	44311	Lucy	60	" All the same I think he ought to know , "
44580	44601	44564	44564	Aslan	72	" Long Live King Peter ! Long Live Queen Susan ! Long Live King Edmund ! Long Live Queen Lucy ! "
44602	44633	44635	44635	Aslan	72	" Once a king or queen in Narnia , always a king or queen . Bear it well , Sons of Adam ! Bear it well , Daughters of Eve ! "
44814	44821	44822	44822	he	71	" He 'll be coming and going "
44826	44892	44822	44822	he	71	" One day you 'll see him and another you wo n't . He does n't like being tied down -- and of course he has other countries to attend to . It 's quite all right . He 'll often drop in . Only you must n't press him . He 's wild , you know . Not like a _ tame _ lion . "
45463	45494	45441	45442	King Peter	109	" Fair Consorts , let us now alight from our horses and follow this beast into the thicket ; for in all my days I never hunted a nobler quarry . "
45495	45498	45500	45501	the others	1252	" Sir , "
45503	45510	45500	45501	the others	1252	" even so let us do . "
45542	45562	45538	45539	Queen Susan	40	" Fair friends , here is a great marvel , for I seem to see a tree of iron . "
45563	45566	45568	45569	King Edmund	36	" Madam , "
45571	45596	45568	45569	King Edmund	36	" if you look well upon it you shall see it is a pillar of iron with a lantern set on the top thereof . "
45597	45604	45606	45607	King Peter	109	" Marry , a strange device , "
45609	45641	45606	45607	King Peter	109	" to set a lantern here where the trees cluster so thick about it and so high above it that if it were lit it should give light to no man ! "
45642	45645	45647	45648	Queen Lucy	107	" Sir , "
45650	45689	45647	45648	Queen Lucy	107	" By likelihood when this post and this lamp were set here there were smaller trees in the place , or fewer , or none . For this is a young wood and the iron post is old . "
45702	45749	45606	45607	King Peter	109	" I know not how it is , but this lamp on the post worketh upon me strangely . It runs in my mind that I have seen the like before ; as it were in a dream , or in the dream of a dream . "
45750	45753	45755	45755	they	1181	" Sir , "
45758	45767	45755	45755	they	1181	" it is even so with us also . "
45768	45772	45774	45775	Queen Lucy	107	" And more , "
45777	45811	45774	45775	Queen Lucy	107	" for it will not go out of my mind that if we pass this post and lantern , either we shall find strange adventures or else some great change of our fortunes . "
45812	45815	45817	45818	King Edmund	36	" Madam , "
45820	45830	45817	45818	King Edmund	36	" the like foreboding stirreth in my heart also . "
45831	45839	45841	45842	King Peter	109	" And in mine , fair brother , "
45844	45850	45852	45853	Queen Susan	40	" And in mine too , "
45855	45875	45852	45853	Queen Susan	40	" Wherefore by my council we shall lightly return to our horses and follow this White Stag no further . "
45876	45879	45881	45882	King Peter	109	" Madam , "
45884	45952	45881	45882	King Peter	109	" therein I pray thee to have me excused . For never since we four were Kings and Queens in Narnia have we set our hands to any high matter , as battles , quests , feats of arms , acts of justice , and the like , and then given over ; but always what we have taken in hand , the same we have achieved . "
45953	45956	45958	45959	Queen Lucy	107	" Sister , "
45961	45999	45958	45959	Queen Lucy	107	" my royal brother speaks rightly . And it seems to me we should be shamed if for any fearing or foreboding we turned back from following so noble a beast as now we have in chase . "
46000	46006	46008	46009	King Edmund	36	" And so say I , "
46011	46046	46008	46009	King Edmund	36	" And I have such desire to find the signification of this thing that I would not by my good will turn back for the richest jewel in all Narnia and all the islands . "
46047	46055	46057	46058	Queen Susan	40	" Then in the name of Aslan , "
46060	46083	46057	46058	Queen Susan	40	" if ye will all have it so , let us go on and take the adventure that shall fall to us . "
46306	46309	46310	46310	he	136	" No , "
46313	46518	46310	46310	he	136	" I do n't think it will be any good trying to go back through the wardrobe door to get the coats . You wo n't get into Narnia again by _ that _ route . Nor would the coats be much use by now if you did ! Eh ? What 's that ? Yes , of course you 'll get back to Narnia again some day . Once a King in Narnia , always a King in Narnia . But do n't go trying to use the same route twice . Indeed , do n't _ try _ to get there at all . It 'll happen when you 're not looking for it . And do n't talk too much about it even among yourselves . And do n't mention it to anyone else unless you find that they 've had adventures of the same sort themselves . What 's that ? How will you know ? Oh , you 'll _ know _ all right . Odd things , they say -- even their looks -- will let the secret out . Keep your eyes open . Bless me , what _ do _ they teach them at these schools ? "
