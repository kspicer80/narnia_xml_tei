              <head>The Island</head>
              <p>Once there were four children whose names were Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, and it
                 has been told in another book called <title><emph rend="italic">The Lion, the Witch
                    and the Wardrobe</emph></title> how they had a remarkable adventure. They had
                 opened the door of a magic wardrobe and found themselves in a quite different world
                 from ours, and in that different world they had become Kings and Queens in a country
                 called Narnia. While they were in Narnia they seemed to reign for years and years;
                 but when they came back through the door and found themselves in England again, it
                 all seemed to have taken no time at all. At any rate, no one noticed that they had
                 ever been away, and they never told anyone except one very wise grown-up.</p>
              <p>That had all happened a year ago, and now all four of them were sitting on a seat at
                 a railway station with trunks and playboxes piled up round them. They were, in fact,
                 on their way back to school. They had travelled together as far as this station,
                 which was a junction; and here, in a few minutes, one train would arrive and take the
                 girls away to one school, and in about half an hour another train would arrive and
                 the boys would go off to another school. The first part of the journey, when they
                 were all together, always seemed to be part of the holidays; but now when they would
                 be saying good-by and going different ways so soon, everyone felt that the holidays
                 were really over and everyone felt their term time feelings beginning again, and they
                 were all rather gloomy and no-one could think of anything to say. Lucy was going to
                 boarding school for the first time.</p>
              <p>It was an empty, sleepy, country station and there was hardly anyone on the platform
                 except themselves. Suddenly Lucy gave a sharp little cry, like someone who has been
                 stung by a wasp.</p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">What's up, Lu?"</said> said Edmund--and then
                 suddenly broke off and made a noise like <said who="ep" aloud="true">"Ow!"</said></p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"What on earth----"</said> began Peter, and
                 then he too suddenly changed what he had been going to say. Instead, he said, <said
                    who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"Susan, let go! What are you doing? Where are
                    you dragging me to?"</said></p>
              <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"I'm not touching you,"</said> said Susan.
                 <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Someone is pulling _me_. Oh--oh--oh--stop
                    it!"</said></p>
              <p>Everyone noticed that all the others' faces had gone very white.</p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"I felt just the same,"</said> said Edmund in
                 a breathless voice. <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"As if I were being
                    dragged along. A most frightful pulling--ugh! it's beginning again."</said></p>
              <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"Me too,"</said> said Lucy. <said
                 who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"Oh, I can't bear it."</said></p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"Look sharp!"</said> shouted Edmund.
                 <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"All catch hands and keep together.
                    This is magic--I can tell by the feeling. Quick!"</said></p>
              <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"Yes,"</said> said Susan. <said
                 who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"Hold hands. Oh, I do wish it would
                 stop--oh!"</said></p>
              <p>Next moment the luggage, the seat, the platform, and the station had completely
                 vanished. The four children, holding hands and panting, found themselves standing in
                 a woody place--such a woody place that branches were sticking into them and there was
                 hardly room to move. They all rubbed their eyes and took a deep breath.</p>
              <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Oh, Peter!"</said> exclaimed Lucy. <said
                 who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Do you think we can possibly have got back to
                 Narnia?"</said></p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"It might be anywhere,"</said> said Peter,
                 <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"I can't see a yard in all these
                    trees. Let's try to get into the open--if there is any open."</said></p>
              <p>With some difficulty, and with some stings from nettles and pricks from thorns, they
                 struggled out of the thicket. Then they had another surprise. Everything became much
                 brighter, and after a few steps they found themselves at the edge of the wood,
                 looking down on a sandy beach. A few yards away a very calm sea was falling on the
                 sand with such tiny ripples that it made hardly any sound. There was no land in sight
                 and no clouds in the sky. The sun was about where it ought to be at ten o'clock in
                 the morning, and the sea was a dazzling blue. They stood sniffing in the
                 sea-smell.</p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"By Jove!"</said> said Peter. <said
                 who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"This is good enough."</said></p>
              <p>Five minutes later everyone was barefooted and wading in the cool clear water.</p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"This is better than being in a stuffy
                 train on the way back to Latin and French and Algebra!"</said> said Edmund. And
                 then for quite a long time there was no more talking, only splashing and looking for
                 shrimps and crabs.</p>
              <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"All the same,"</said> said Susan
                 presently, <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"I suppose we'll have to
                    make some plans. We shall want something to eat before long."</said></p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"We've got the sandwiches Mother gave
                 us for the journey,"</said> said Edmund. <said who="ep" aloud="true"
                    toWhom="pp ep lp">"At least I've got mine."</said></p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"Not me,"</said> said Lucy. <said
                 who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"Mine were in my little bag."</said></p>
              <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"So were mine,"</said> said Susan.</p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"Mine are in my coat-pocket, there on
                 the beach,"</said> said Peter. <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp"
                    >"That'll be two lunches among four. This isn't going to be such fun."</said></p>
              <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"At present,"</said> said Lucy, <said
                 who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"I want something to drink more than
                 something to eat."</said></p>
              <p>Everyone else now felt thirsty, as one usually is after wading in salt water under a
                 hot sun.</p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"It's like being shipwrecked,"</said>
                 remarked Edmund. <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"In the books they
                    always find springs of clear, fresh water on the island. We'd better go and look
                    for them."</said></p>
              <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"Does that mean we have to go back into
                 all that thick wood?"</said> said Susan.</p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"Not a bit of it,"</said> said Peter.
                 <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"If there are streams they're bound
                    to come down to the sea, and if we walk along the beach we're bound to come to
                    them."</said></p>
              <p>They all now waded back and went first across the smooth, wet sand and then up to the
                 dry, crumbly sand that sticks to one's toes, and began putting on their shoes and
                 socks. Edmund and Lucy wanted to leave them behind and do their exploring with bare
                 feet, but Susan said this would be a mad thing to do. <said who="sp" aloud="true"
                    toWhom="pp ep lp">"We might never find them again,"</said> she pointed out, <said
                       who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"and we shall want them if we're still
                       here when night comes and it begins to be cold."</said></p>
              <p>When they were dressed again they set out along the shore with the sea on their left
                 hand and the wood on their right. Except for an occasional seagull it was a very
                 quiet place. The wood was so thick and tangled that they could hardly see into it at
                 all; and nothing in it moved--not a bird, not even an insect.</p>
              <p>Shells and seaweed and anemones, or tiny crabs in rock-pools, are all very well, but
                 you soon get tired of them if you are thirsty. The children's feet, after the change
                 from the cool water, felt hot and heavy. Susan and Lucy had raincoats to carry.
                 Edmund had put down his coat on the station seat just before the magic overtook them,
                 and he and Peter took it in turns to carry Peter's great-coat.</p>
              <p>Presently the shore began to curve round to the right. About quarter of an hour
                 later, after they had crossed a rocky ridge which ran out into a point, it made quite
                 a sharp turn. Their backs were now to the part of the sea which had met them when
                 they first came out of the wood, and now, looking ahead, they could see across the
                 water another shore, thickly wooded like the one they were exploring.</p>
              <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"I wonder, is that an island or do we
                 join on to it presently?"</said> said Lucy.</p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"Don't know,"</said> said Peter and
                 they all plodded on in silence.</p>
              <p>The shore that they were walking on drew nearer and nearer to the opposite shore, and
                 as they came round each promontory the children expected to find the place where the
                 two joined. But in this they were disappointed. They came to some rocks which they
                 had to climb and from the top they could see a fair way ahead and--<said who="ep"
                    aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"Oh bother!"</said> said Edmund, <said who="ep"
                       aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"it's no good. We shan't be able to get to those
                       other woods at all. We're on an island!"</said></p>
              <p>It was true. At this point the channel between them and the opposite coast was only
                 about thirty or forty yards wide; but they could now see that this was its narrowest
                 place. After that, their own coast bent round to the right again and they could see
                 open sea between it and the mainland. It was obvious that they had already come much
                 more than half-way round the island.</p>
              <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"Look!"</said> said Lucy suddenly.
                 <said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"What's that?"</said> She pointed to
                 a long silvery, snake-like thing that lay across the beach.</p>
              <p><said who="pp sp ep" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"A stream! A stream!"</said> shouted
                 the others, and, tired as they were, they lost no time in clattering down the rocks
                 and racing to the fresh water. They knew that the stream would be better to drink
                 farther up, away from the beach, so they went at once to the spot where it came out
                 of the wood. The trees were as thick as ever, but the stream had made itself a deep
                 course between high mossy banks so that by stooping you could follow it up in a sort
                 of tunnel of leaves. They dropped on their knees by the first brown, dimply pool and
                 drank and drank, and dipped their faces in the water, and then dipped their arms in
                 up to the elbow.</p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"Now,"</said> said Edmund, <said
                 who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"what about those sandwiches?"</said></p>
              <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"Oh, hadn't we better save
                 them?"</said> said Susan. <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"We may
                    need them far worse later on."</said></p>
              <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"I do wish,"</said> said Lucy, <said
                 who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"now that we're not thirsty, we could go
                 on feeling as not-hungry as we did when we _were_ thirsty."</said></p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"But what about those
                 sandwiches?"</said> repeated Edmund. <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp"
                    >"There's no good saving them till they go bad. You've got to remember it's a good
                    deal hotter here than in England and we've been carrying them about in pockets for
                    hours."</said> So they got out the two packets and divided them into four
                 portions, and nobody had quite enough, but it was a great deal better than nothing.
                 Then they talked about their plans for the next meal. Lucy wanted to go back to the
                 sea and catch shrimps, until someone pointed out that they had no nets. Edmund said
                 they must gather gulls' eggs from the rocks, but when they came to think of it they
                 couldn't remember having seen any gulls' eggs and wouldn't be able to cook them if
                 they found any. Peter thought to himself that unless they had some stroke of luck
                 they would soon be glad to eat eggs raw, but he didn't see any point in saying this
                 out loud. Susan said it was a pity they had eaten the sandwiches so soon. One or two
                 tempers very nearly got lost at this stage. Finally Edmund said:</p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"Look here. There's only one thing to
                 be done. We must explore the wood. Hermits and knights-errant and people like that
                 always manage to live somehow if they're in a forest. They find roots and berries
                 and things."</said></p>
              <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"What sort of roots?"</said> asked
                 Susan.</p>
              <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"I always thought it meant roots of
                 trees,"</said> said Lucy.</p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"Come on,"</said> said Peter, <said
                 who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"Ed is right. And we must try to do
                 something. And it'll be better than going out into the glare and the sun
                 again."</said></p>
              <p>So they all got up and began to follow the stream. It was very hard work. They had to
                 stoop under branches and climb over branches, and they blundered through great masses
                 of stuff like rhododendrons and tore their clothes and got their feet wet in the
                 stream; and still there was no noise at all except the noise of the stream and the
                 noises they were making themselves. They were beginning to get very tired of it when
                 they noticed a delicious smell, and then a flash of bright colour high above them at
                 the top of the right bank.</p>
              <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"I say!"</said> exclaimed Lucy. <said
                 who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"I do believe that's an apple
                 tree."</said></p>
              <p>It was. They panted up the steep bank, forced their way through some brambles, and
                 found themselves standing round an old tree that was heavy with large
                 yellowish-golden apples as firm and juicy as you could wish to see.</p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"And this is not the only tree,"</said>
                 said Edmund with his mouth full of apple. <said who="ep" aloud="true"
                    toWhom="pp sp lp">"Look there--and there."</said></p>
              <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"Why, there are dozens of them,"</said>
                 said Susan, throwing away the core of her first apple and picking her second. <said
                    who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"This must have been an orchard--long,
                    long ago, before the place went wild and the wood grew up."</said></p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"Then this was once an inhabited
                 island,"</said> said Peter.</p>
              <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"And what's that?"</said> said Lucy,
                 pointing ahead.</p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"By Jove, it's a wall,"</said> said
                 Peter. <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"An old stone wall."</said></p>
              <p>Pressing their way between the laden branches they reached the wall. It was very old,
                 and broken down in places, with moss and wallflowers growing on it, but it was higher
                 than all but the tallest trees. And when they came quite close to it they found a
                 great arch which must once have had a gate in it but was now almost filled up with
                 the largest of all the apple trees. They had to break some of the branches to get
                 past, and when they had done so they all blinked because the daylight became suddenly
                 much brighter. They found themselves in a wide open place with walls all round it. In
                 here there were no trees, only level grass and daisies, and ivy, and grey walls. It
                 was a bright, secret, quiet place, and rather sad; and all four stepped out into the
                 middle of it, glad to be able to straighten their backs and move their limbs
                 freely.</p>

              <head>The Ancient Treasure House</head>
              <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"This wasn't a garden,"</said> said
                 Susan presently. <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"It was a castle and
                    this must have been the courtyard."</said></p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"I see what you mean,"</said> said Peter.
                    <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"Yes. That is the remains of a
                    tower. And there is what used to be a flight of steps going up to the top of the
                    walls. And look at those other steps--the broad, shallow ones--going up to that
                    doorway. It must have been the door into the great hall."</said></p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"Ages ago, by the look of it,"</said>
                 said Edmund.</p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"Yes, ages ago,"</said> said Peter.
                    <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"I wish we could find out who the
                    people were that lived in this castle; and how long ago."</said></p>
              <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"It gives me a queer feeling,"</said>
                 said Lucy.</p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Does it, Lu?"</said> said Peter, turning and
                 looking hard at her. <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Because it does the
                    same to me. It is the queerest thing that has happened this queer day. I wonder
                    where we are and what it all means?"</said></p>
              <p>While they were talking they had crossed the courtyard and gone through the other
                 doorway into what had once been the hall. This was now very like the courtyard, for
                 the roof had long since disappeared and it was merely another space of grass and
                 daisies, except that it was shorter and narrower and the walls were higher. Across
                 the far end there was a kind of terrace about three feet higher than the rest.</p>
              <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"I wonder, was it really the
                    hall?"</said> said Susan. <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"What's
                    that terrace kind of thing?"</said></p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"Why, you silly,"</said> said Peter (who had
                 become strangely excited), <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"don't you see?
                    That was the dais where the High Table was, where the King and the great lords
                    sat. Anyone would think you had forgotten that we ourselves were once Kings and
                    Queens and sat on a dais just like that, in our great hall."</said></p>
              <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"In our castle of Cair Paravel,"</said>
                 continued Susan in a dreamy and rather sing-song voice, <said who="sp" aloud="true"
                    toWhom="pp ep lp">"at the mouth of the great river of Narnia. How could I
                    forget?"</said></p>
              <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"How it all comes back!"</said> said
                 Lucy. <said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"We could pretend we were in Cair
                    Paravel now. This hall must have been very like the great hall we feasted
                    in."</said></p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"But unfortunately without the
                    feast,"</said> said Edmund. <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"It's
                    getting late, you know. Look how long the shadows are. And have you noticed that
                    it isn't so hot?"</said></p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"We shall need a camp fire if we've got
                    to spend the night here,"</said> said Peter. <said who="pp" aloud="true"
                    toWhom="sp ep lp">"I've got matches. Let's go and see if we can collect some dry
                    wood."</said></p>
              <p>Everyone saw the sense of this, and for the next half-hour they were busy. The
                 orchard through which they had first come into the ruins turned out not to be a good
                 place for firewood. They tried the other side of the castle, passing out of the hall
                 by a little side door into a maze of stony humps and hollows which must once have
                 been passages and smaller rooms but was now all nettles and wild roses. Beyond this
                 they found a wide gap in the castle wall and stepped through it into a wood of darker
                 and bigger trees where they found dead branches and rotten wood and sticks and dry
                 leaves and fir-cones in plenty. They went to and fro with bundles until they had a
                 good pile on the dais. At the fifth journey they found the well, just outside the
                 hall, hidden in weeds, but clean and fresh and deep when they had cleared these away.
                 The remains of a stone pavement ran half-way round it. Then the girls went out to
                 pick some more apples and the boys built the fire, on the dais and fairly close to
                 the corner between two walls, which they thought would be the snuggest and warmest
                 place. They had great difficulty in lighting it and used a lot of matches, but they
                 succeeded in the end. Finally, all four sat down with their backs to the wall and
                 their faces to the fire. They tried roasting some of the apples on the ends of
                 sticks. But roast apples are not much good without sugar, and they are too hot to eat
                 with your fingers till they are too cold to be worth eating. So they had to content
                 themselves with raw apples, which, as Edmund said, made one realise that school
                 suppers weren't so bad after all--<said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">I
                    shouldn't mind a good thick slice of bread and margarine this minute,"</said> he
                 added. But the spirit of adventure was rising in them all, and no one really wanted
                 to be back at school.</p>
              <p>Shortly after the last apple had been eaten, Susan went out to the well to get
                 another drink. When she came back she was carrying something in her hand.</p>
              <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"Look,"</said> she said in a rather
                 choking kind of voice. <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"I found it by
                    the well."</said> She handed it to Peter and sat down. The others thought she
                 looked and sounded as if she might be going to cry. Edmund and Lucy eagerly bent
                 forward to see what was in Peter's hand--a little bright thing that gleamed in the
                 firelight.</p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"Well, I'm--I'm jiggered,"</said> said
                 Peter, and his voice also sounded queer. Then he handed it to the others.</p>
              <p>All now saw what it was--a little chess-knight, ordinary in size but extraordinarily
                 heavy because it was made of pure gold; and the eyes in the horse's head were two
                 tiny little rubies--or rather one was, for the other had been knocked out. </p>
              <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"Why!"</said> said Lucy, <said who="lp"
                    aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"it's exactly like one of the golden chessmen we
                    used to play with when we were Kings and Queens at Cair Paravel."</said></p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"Cheer up, Su,"</said> said Peter to his
                 other sister. </p>
              <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"I can't help it,"</said> said Susan.
                    <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"It brought back--oh, such lovely
                    times. And I remembered playing chess with fauns and good giants, and the
                    mer-people singing in the sea, and my beautiful horse--and--and----"</said></p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"Now,"</said> said Peter in a quite
                 different voice, <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"it's about time we
                    four started using our brains."</said></p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"What about?"</said> asked Edmund.</p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"Have none of you guessed where we
                    are?"</said> said Peter.</p>
              <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Go on, go on,"</said> said Lucy. <said
                    who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"I've felt for hours that there was some
                    wonderful mystery hanging over this place."</said></p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"Fire ahead, Peter,"</said> said
                 Edmund. <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"We're all
                 listening."</said></p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"We are in the ruins of Cair Paravel
                    itself,"</said> said Peter.</p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">But, I say,"</said> replied Edmund.
                    <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"I mean, how do you make that out?
                    This place has been ruined for ages. Look at all those big trees growing right up
                    to the gates. Look at the very stones. Anyone can see that nobody has lived here
                    for hundreds of years."</said></p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"I know,"</said> said Peter. <said
                    who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"That is the difficulty. But let's leave
                    that out for the moment. I want to take the points one by one. First point: this
                    hall is exactly the same shape and size as the hall at Cair Paravel. Just picture
                    a roof on this, and a coloured pavement instead of grass, and tapestries on the
                    walls, and you get our royal banqueting hall."</said></p>
              <p>No one said anything.</p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"Second point,"</said> continued Peter.
                    <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"The castle well is exactly where
                    our well was, a little to the south of the great hall; and it is exactly the same
                    size and shape."</said></p>
              <p>Again there was no reply.</p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"Third point: Susan has just found one
                    of our old chessmen--or something as like one of them as two peas."</said></p>
              <p>Still nobody answered.</p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"Fourth point. Don't you remember--it
                    was the very day before the ambassadors came from the King of Calormen--don't you
                    remember planting the orchard outside the north gate of Cair Paravel? The greatest
                    of all the wood-people, Pomona herself, came to put good spells on it. It was
                    those very decent little chaps the moles who did the actual digging. Can you have
                    forgotten that funny old Lilygloves, the chief mole, leaning on his spade and
                    saying, <q>'Believe me, your Majesty, you'll be glad of these fruit trees one
                       day.'</q> And by Jove he was right."</said></p>
              <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"I do! I do!"</said> said Lucy, and
                 clapped her hands.</p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"But look here, Peter,"</said> said Edmund.
                    <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"This must be all rot. To begin with, we
                    didn't plant the orchard slap up against the gate. We wouldn't have been such
                    fools."</said></p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"No, of course not,"</said> said Peter. <said
                    who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"But it has grown up to the gate
                 since."</said></p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"And for another thing,"</said> said Edmund,
                    <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Cair Paravel wasn't on an
                 island."</said></p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"Yes, I've been wondering about that.
                    But it was a what-do-you-call-it, a peninsula. Jolly nearly an island. Couldn't it
                    have been made an island since our time? Somebody has dug a channel."</said></p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"But half a moment!"</said> said Edmund.
                    <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"You keep on saying <emph rend="italic"
                       >since our time</emph>. But it's only a year ago since we came back from
                    Narnia. And you want to make out that in one year castles have fallen down, and
                    great forests have grown up, and little trees we saw planted ourselves have turned
                    into a big old orchard, and goodness knows what else. It's all
                 impossible."</said></p>
              <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"There's one thing,"</said> said Lucy.
                    <said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"If this is Cair Paravel there ought
                    to be a door at this end of the dais. In fact we ought to be sitting with our
                    backs against it at this moment. You know--the door that led down to the treasure
                    chamber."</said></p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"I suppose there isn't a door,"</said>
                 said Peter, getting up.</p>
              <p>The wall behind them was a mass of ivy.</p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"We can soon find out,""</said> said
                 Edmund, taking up one of the sticks that they had laid ready for putting on the fire.
                 He began beating the ivied wall. Tap-tap went the stick against the stone; and again,
                 tap-tap; and then, all at once, boom-boom, with a quite different sound, a hollow,
                 wooden sound.</p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"Great Scott!"</said> said Edmund.</p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"We must clear this ivy away,"</said>
                 said Peter.</p>
              <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"Oh, do let's leave it alone,""</said>
                 said Susan. <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"We can try it in the
                    morning. If we've got to spend the night here I don't want an open door at my back
                    and a great big black hole that anything might come out of, besides the draught
                    and the damp. And it'll soon be dark."</said></p>
              <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"Susan! How can you?"</said> said Lucy with a
                 reproachful glance. But both the boys were too much excited to take any notice of
                 Susan's advice. They worked at the ivy with their hands and with Peter's pocket knife
                 till the knife broke. After that they used Edmund's. Soon the whole place where they
                 had been sitting was covered with ivy; and at last they had the door cleared.</p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"Locked, of course,"</said> said
                 Peter.</p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"But the wood's all rotten,"</said>
                 said Edmund. <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">We can pull it to bits in
                    no time, and it will make extra firewood. Come on."</said></p>
              <p>It took them longer than they expected and, before they had done, the great hall had
                 grown dusky and the first star or two had come out overhead. Susan was not the only
                 one who felt a slight shudder as the boys stood above the pile of splintered wood,
                 rubbing the dirt off their hands and staring into the cold, dark opening they had
                 made. </p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"Now for a torch,"</said> said
                 Peter.</p>
              <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"Oh, what is the good?"</said> said
                 Susan. <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"And as Edmund
                 said----"</said></p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"I'm not saying it now,"</said> Edmund
                 interrupted. <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"I still don't understand,
                    but we can settle that later. I suppose you're coming down, Peter?"</said></p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"We must,"</said> said Peter. <said
                    who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"Cheer up, Susan. It's no good behaving like
                    kids now that we are back in Narnia. You're a queen here. And anyway no-one could
                    go to sleep with a mystery like this on our minds."</said></p>
              <p>They tried to use long sticks as torches but this was not a success. If you held them
                 with the lighted end up they went out, and if you held them the other way they
                 scorched your hand and the smoke got in your eyes. In the end they had to use
                 Edmund's electric torch; luckily it had been a birthday present less than a week ago
                 and the battery was almost new. He went first, with the light. Then came Lucy, then
                 Susan, and Peter brought up the rear. </p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"I've come to the top of the
                    steps,"</said> said Edmund.</p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"Count them,"</said> said Peter.</p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true">"One--two--three,"</said> said Edmund, as he went
                 cautiously down, and so up to sixteen. <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp"
                    >"And this is the bottom,"</said> he shouted back. </p>
              <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"Then it really must be Cair
                    Paravel,"</said> said Lucy. <said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"There
                    were sixteen."</said> Nothing more was said till all four were standing in a knot
                 together at the foot of the stairway. Then Edmund flashed his torch slowly round.</p>
              <p><said who="pp sp ep lp" aloud="true">"O--o--o--oh!!"</said> said all the children at
                 once.</p>
              <p>For now all knew that it was indeed the ancient treasure chamber of Cair Paravel
                 where they had once reigned as Kings and Queens of Narnia. There was a kind of path
                 up the middle (as it might be in a greenhouse), and along each side at intervals
                 stood rich suits of armour, like knights guarding the treasures. In between the suits
                 of armour, and on each side of the path, were shelves covered with precious
                 things--necklaces and arm rings and finger rings and golden bowls and dishes and long
                 tusks of ivory, brooches and coronets and chains of gold, and heaps of unset stones
                 lying piled anyhow as if they were marbles or potatoes--diamonds, rubies, carbuncles,
                 emeralds, topazes and amethysts. Under the shelves stood great chests of oak
                 strengthened with iron bars and heavily padlocked. And it was bitterly cold, and so
                 still that they could hear themselves breathing, and the treasures were so covered
                 with dust that unless they had realised where they were and remembered most of the
                 things, they would hardly have known they were treasures. There was something sad and
                 a little frightening about the place, because it all seemed so forsaken and long ago.
                 That was why nobody said anything for at least a minute.</p>
              <p>Then, of course, they began walking about and picking things up to look at. It was
                 like meeting very old friends. If you had been there you would have heard them saying
                 things like, <said who="pp sp ep lp" aloud="true">"Oh look! Our coronation rings--do
                    you remember first wearing this?--Why, this is the little brooch we all thought
                    was lost--I say, isn't that the armour you wore in the great tournament in the
                    Lone Islands?--do you remember the dwarf making that for me?--do you remember
                    drinking out of that horn?--do you remember, do you remember?"</said></p>
              <p>But suddenly Edmund said, <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"Look here.
                    We mustn't waste the battery: goodness knows how often we shall need it. Hadn't we
                    better take what we want and get out again?"</said></p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"We must take the gifts,"</said> said
                 Peter. For long ago at a Christmas in Narnia he and Susan and Lucy had been given
                 certain presents which they valued more than their whole kingdom. Edmund had had no
                 gift, because he was not with them at the time. (This was his own fault, and you can
                 read about it in the other book.) </p>
              <p>They all agreed with Peter and walked up the path to the wall at the far end of the
                 treasure chamber, and there, sure enough, the gifts were still hanging. Lucy's was
                 the smallest for it was only a little bottle. But the bottle was made of diamond
                 instead of glass, and it was still more than half full of the magical cordial which
                 would heal almost every wound and every illness. Lucy said nothing and looked very
                 solemn as she took her gift down from its place and slung the belt over her shoulder
                 and once more felt the bottle at her side where it used to hang in the old days.
                 Susan's gift had been a bow and arrows and a horn. The bow was still there, and the
                 ivory quiver, full of well-feathered arrows, but--<said who="lp" aloud="true"
                    toWhom="sp">"Oh, Susan,"</said> said Lucy. <said who="lp" aloud="true"
                    toWhom="pp sp ep">"Where's the horn?" </said></p>
              <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"Oh bother, bother, bother,"</said>
                 said Susan after she had thought for a moment. <said who="sp" aloud="true"
                    toWhom="pp ep lp">"I remember now. I took it with me the last day of all, the day
                    we went hunting the White Stag. It must have got lost when we blundered back into
                    that other place--England, I mean."</said></p>
              <p>Edmund whistled. It was indeed a most shattering loss; for this was an enchanted horn
                 and, whenever you blew it, help was certain to come to you, wherever you were. </p>
              <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"Just the sort of thing that might come
                    in handy in a place like this,"</said> said Edmund.</p>
              <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"Never mind,"</said> said Susan, <said
                    who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"I've still got the bow."</said> And she
                 took it.</p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"Won't the string be perished, Su?"</said>
                 said Peter.</p>
              <p>But whether by some magic in the air of the treasure chamber or not, the bow was
                 still in working order. Archery and swimming were the things Susan was good at. In a
                 moment she had bent the bow and then she gave one little pluck to the string. It
                 twanged: a chirruping twang that vibrated through the whole room. And that one small
                 noise brought back the old days to the children's minds more than anything that had
                 happened yet. All the battles and hunts and feasts came rushing into their heads
                 together.</p>
              <p>Then she unstrung the bow again and slung the quiver at her side.</p>
              <p>Next, Peter took down his gift--the shield with the great red lion on it, and the
                 royal sword. He blew, and rapped them on the floor, to get off the dust. He fitted
                 the shield on his arm and slung the sword by his side. He was afraid at first that it
                 might be rusty and stick to the sheath. But it was not so. With one swift motion he
                 drew it and held it up, shining in the torchlight.</p>
              <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"It is my sword Rhindon,"</said> he
                 said; <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"with it I killed the
                    Wolf."</said> There was a new tone in his voice, and the others all felt that he
                 was really Peter the High King again. Then, after a little pause, everyone remembered
                 that they must save the battery.</p>
              <p>They climbed the stair again and made up a good fire and lay down close together for
                 warmth. The ground was very hard and uncomfortable, but they fell asleep in the
                 end.</p>
           </div>
         <div type="chapter" n="3">
            <head>The Dwarf</head>
            <p>The worst of sleeping out of doors is that you wake up so dreadfully early. And when
               you wake you have to get up because the ground is so hard that you are uncomfortable.
               And it makes matters worse if there is nothing but apples for breakfast and you have
               had nothing but apples for supper the night before. When Lucy had said--truly
               enough--that it was a glorious morning, there did not seem to be anything else nice
               to be said. Edmund said what everyone was feeling, <said who="ep" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp sp lp">"We've simply got to get off this island."</said></p>
            <p>When they had drunk from the well and splashed their faces they all went down the
               stream again to the shore and stared at the channel which divided them from the
               mainland.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"We'll have to swim,"</said> said

               said Peter (Susan had won prizes for swimming at school). <said who="pp" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="sp ep lp">"But I don't know about the rest of us."</said> By "the rest of
               us" he really meant Edmund, who couldn't yet do two lengths at the school baths, and
               Lucy, who could hardly swim at all.</p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"Anyway,"</said> said Susan, <said
                  who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"there may be currents. Father says it's

            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"But, Peter,"</said> said Lucy, <said
                  who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"look here. I know I can't swim for nuts at
                  home--in England, I mean. But couldn't we all swim long ago--if it was long

                  sorts of things. Don't you think----"</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Ah, but we were sort of grown-up
                  then,"</said> said Peter. <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"We reigned for
                  years and years and learned to do things. Aren't we just back at our proper ages
                  again now?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"Oh!"</said> said Edmund in a voice
               which made everyone stop talking and listen to him.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"I've just seen it all,"</said> he
               said.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"Seen what?"</said> asked Peter.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Why, the whole thing,"</said> said Edmund.
                  <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"You know what we were puzzling

                  you see? You know that, however long we seemed to have lived in Narnia, when we
                  got back through the wardrobe it seemed to have taken no time at all?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"Go on,"</said> said Susan. <said who="sp"

            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"And that means,"</said> continued

            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"By Jove, Ed,"</said> said Peter. <said
                  who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"I believe you've got it. In that sense it
                  really was hundreds of years ago that we lived in Cair Paravel. And now we're
                  coming back to Narnia just as if we were Crusaders or Anglo-Saxons or Ancient
                  Britons or someone coming back to modern England!"</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"How excited they'll be to see
                  us----"</said> began Lucy, but at the same moment everyone else said <said
                  who="pp sp ep lp" aloud="true">"Hush!"</said> or <said who="pp sp ep lp"
                  aloud="true">"Look!"</said> For now something was happening.</p>
            <p>There was a wooded point on the mainland a little to their right, and they all felt
               sure that just beyond that point must be the mouth of the river. And now, round that
               point there came into sight a boat. When it had cleared the point, it turned and
               began coming along the channel towards them. There were two people on board, one
               rowing, the other sitting in the stern and holding a bundle that twitched and moved
               as if it were alive. Both these people seemed to be soldiers. They had steel caps on
               their heads and light shirts of chain-mail. Their faces were bearded and hard. The
               children drew back from the beach into the wood and watched without moving a
               finger.</p>
            <p><said who="mirazcorporal" aloud="true" toWhom="mirazsold1">"This'll do,"</said> said
               the soldier in the stern when the boat had come about opposite to them.</p>
            <p><said who="mirazsold1" aloud="true" toWhom="mirazcorporal">"What about tying a stone
                  to his feet, Corporal?"</said> said the other, resting on his oars.</p>
            <p><said who="mirazcorporal" aloud="true" toWhom="mirazsold1">"Garn!"</said> growled the
               other. <said who="mirazcorporal" aloud="true" toWhom="mirazsold1">"We don't need
                  that, and we haven't brought one. He'll drown sure enough without a stone, as long
                  as we've tied the cords right."</said> With these words he rose and lifted his
               bundle. Peter now saw that it was really alive and was in fact a Dwarf, bound hand
               and foot but struggling as hard as he could. Next moment he heard a twang just beside
               his ear, and all at once the soldier threw up his arms, dropping the Dwarf in the
               bottom of the boat, and fell over into the water. He floundered away to the far bank
               and Peter knew that Susan's arrow had struck on his helmet. He turned and saw that
               she was very pale but was already fitting a second arrow to the string. But it was
               never used. As soon as he saw his companion fall, the other soldier, with a loud cry,
               jumped out of the boat on the far side, and he also floundered through the water
               (which was apparently just in his depth) and disappeared into the woods of the
               mainland.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"Quick! Before she drifts!"</said>
               shouted Peter. He and Susan, fully dressed as they were, plunged in, and before the
               water was up to their shoulders their hands were on the side of the boat. In a few
               seconds they had hauled her to the bank and lifted the Dwarf out, and Edmund was
               busily engaged in cutting his bonds with the pocket knife. (Peter's sword would have
               been sharper, but a sword is very inconvenient for this sort of work because you
               can't hold it anywhere lower than the hilt.) When at last the dwarf was free, he sat
               up, rubbed his arms and legs, and exclaimed:</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"Well, whatever they say, you
                  don't <emph rend="italic">feel</emph> like ghosts."</said></p>
            <p>Like most Dwarfs he was very stocky and deep-chested. He would have been about three
               feet high if he had been standing up, and an immense beard and whiskers of coarse red
               hair left little of his face to be seen except beak-like nose and twinkling black
               eyes.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"Anyway,"</said> he continued,
                  <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"ghosts or not, you've
                  saved my life and I'm extremely obliged to you."</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"But why should we be ghosts?"</said>
               asked Lucy.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"I've been told all my life,"
                  said the Dwarf, "that these woods along the shore were as full of ghosts as they
                  were of trees. That's what the story is. And that's why, when they want to get rid
                  of anyone, they usually bring him down here (like they were doing with me) and say
                  they'll leave him to the ghosts. But I always wondered if they didn't really drown
                  'em or cut their throats. I never quite believed in the ghosts. But those two
                  cowards you've just shot believed all right. They were more frightened of taking
                  me to my death than I was of going!"</said></p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"Oh,"</said> said Susan. <said who="sp"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"So that's why they both ran away."</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"Eh? What's that?"</said> said the
               Dwarf.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"They got away,"</said> said Edmund.
                  <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"To the mainland."</said></p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"I wasn't shooting to kill, you know,"</said>
               said Susan. She would not have liked anyone to think she could miss at such a short
               range.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"Hm,"</said> said the Dwarf.
                  <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"That's not so good. That
                  may mean trouble later on. Unless they hold their tongues for their own
                  sake."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"What were they going to drown you
                  for?"</said> asked Peter.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"Oh, I'm a dangerous criminal,
                  I am,"</said> said the Dwarf cheerfully. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"But that's a long story. Meantime, I was wondering if
                  perhaps you were going to ask me to breakfast? You've no idea what an appetite it
                  gives one, being executed."</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"There's only apples,"</said> said Lucy
               dolefully.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Better than nothing, but not so good
                  as fresh fish,"</said> said the Dwarf. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"It looks as if I'll have to ask you to breakfast instead. I
                  saw some fishing tackle in that boat. And anyway, we must take her round to the
                  other side of the island. We don't want anyone from the mainland coming down and
                  seeing her."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"I ought to have thought of that
                  myself,"</said> said Peter.</p>
            <p>The four children and the Dwarf went down to the water's edge, pushed off the boat
               with some difficulty, and scrambled aboard. The Dwarf at once took charge. The oars
               were of course too big for him to use, so Peter rowed and the Dwarf steered them
               north along the channel and presently eastward round the tip of the island. From here
               the children could see right up the river, and all the bays and headlands of the
               coast beyond it. They thought they could recognise bits of it, but the woods, which
               had grown up since their time, made everything look very different.</p>
            <p>When they had come round into open sea on the east of the island, the Dwarf took to
               fishing. They had an excellent catch of pavenders, a beautiful rainbow-coloured fish
               which they all remembered eating in Cair Paravel in the old days. When they had
               caught enough they ran the boat up into a little creek and moored her to a tree. The
               Dwarf, who was a most capable person (and, indeed, though one meets bad Dwarfs, I
               never heard of a Dwarf who was a fool), cut the fish open, cleaned them, and
               said:</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"Now, what we want next is
                  some firewood."</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"We've got some up at the
                  castle,"</said> said Edmund.</p>
            <p>The Dwarf gave a low whistle. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"Beards
                  and bedsteads!"</said> he said. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"So there really is a castle, after all?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"It's only a ruin,"</said> said
               Lucy.</p>
            <p>The Dwarf stared round at all four of them with a very curious expression on his
               face. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"And who on
                  earth----"</said> he began, but then broke off and said, <said who="trumpkin"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"No matter. Breakfast first. But one thing
                  before we go on. Can you lay your hand on your hearts and tell me I'm really
                  alive? Are you sure I wasn't drowned and we're not all ghosts
               together?"</said></p>
            <p>When they had all reassured him, the next question was how to carry the fish. They
               had nothing to string them on and no basket. They had to use Edmund's hat in the end
               because no one else had a hat. He would have made much more fuss about this if he had
               not by now been so ravenously hungry.</p>
            <p>At first the Dwarf did not seem very comfortable in the castle. He kept looking round
               and sniffing and saying, <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"H'm.
                  Looks a bit spooky after all. Smells like ghosts, too."</said> But he cheered up
               when it came to lighting the fire and showing them how to roast the fresh pavenders
               in the embers. Eating hot fish with no forks, and one pocket knife between five
               people, is a messy business and there were several burnt fingers before the meal was
               ended; but, as it was now nine o'clock and they had been up since five, nobody minded
               the burns so much as you might have expected. When everyone had finished off with a
               drink from the well and an apple or so, the Dwarf produced a pipe about the size of
               his own arm, filled it, lit it, blew a great cloud of fragrant smoke and said, <said
                  who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"Now."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"You tell us your story first,"</said>
               said Peter. <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"And then we'll tell you
                  ours."</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"Well,"</said> said the Dwarf,
                  <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"as you've saved my life it
                  is only fair you should have your own way. But I hardly know where to begin. First
                  of all I'm a messenger of King Caspian's."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp sp ep lp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"Who's he?" asked four voices
                  all at once.</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"Caspian the Tenth, King of
                  Narnia, and long may he reign!"</said> answered the Dwarf. <said who="trumpkin"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"That is to say, he ought to be King of Narnia
                  and we hope he will be. At present he is only King of us Old
               Narnians----"</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"What do you mean by <emph
                     rend="italic">old</emph> Narnians, please?"</said> asked Lucy.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Why, that's us,"</said> said the
               Dwarf. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"We're a kind of
                  rebellion, I suppose."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"I see,"</said> said Peter. <said
                  who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"And Caspian is the chief Old
                  Narnian."</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Well, in a manner of speaking,"</said>
               said the Dwarf, scratching his head. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"But he's really a New Narnian himself, a Telmarine, if you
                  follow me."</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"I don't,"</said> said Edmund.</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"It's worse than the Wars of the
                  Roses,"</said> said Lucy.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"Oh dear,"</said> said the
                  Dwarf.<said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp"> "I'm doing this very
                  badly. Look here: I think I'll have to go right back to the beginning and tell you
                  how Caspian grew up in his uncle's court and how he comes to be on our side at
                  all. But it'll be a long story."</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"All the better,"</said> said Lucy.
                  <said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"We love stories."</said></p>
            <p>So the Dwarf settled down and told his tale. I shall not give it to you in his words,
               putting in all the children's questions and interruptions, because it would take too
               long and be confusing, and, even so, it would leave out some points that the children
               only heard later. But the gist of the story, as they knew it in the end, was as
               follows.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="chapter" n="4">
            <head>The Dwarf Tells of Prince Caspian</head>
            <p>Prince Caspian lived in a great castle in the centre of Narnia with his uncle, Miraz,
               the King of Narnia, and his aunt, who had red hair and was called Queen Prunaprismia.
               His father and mother were dead and the person whom Caspian loved best was his nurse,
               and though (being a prince) he had wonderful toys which would do almost anything but
               talk, he liked best the last hour of the day when the toys had all been put back in
               their cupboards and Nurse would tell him stories.</p>
            <p>He did not care much for his uncle and aunt, but about twice a week his uncle would
               send for him and they would walk up and down together for half an hour on the terrace
               at the south side of the castle. One day, while they were doing this, the King said
               to him,</p>
            <p><said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Well, boy, we must soon teach you to ride
                  and use a sword. You know that your aunt and I have no children, so it looks as if
                  you might have to be King when I'm gone. How shall you like that, eh?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz">"I don't know, Uncle,"</said> said
               Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Don't know, eh?"</said> said Miraz. <said
                  who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Why, I should like to know what more anyone
                  could wish for!"</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz">"All the same, I <emph rend="italic"
                     >do</emph> wish,"</said> said Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"What do you wish?"</said> asked the
               King.</p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz">"I wish--I wish--I wish I could have lived
                  in the Old Days,"</said> said Caspian. (He was only a very little boy at the
               time.)</p>
            <p>Up till now King Miraz had been talking in the tiresome way that some grown-ups have,
               which makes it quite clear that they are not really interested in what they are
               saying, but now he suddenly gave Caspian a very sharp look.</p>
            <p><said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Eh? What's that?"</said> he said. <said
                  who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"What old days do you mean?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz">"Oh, don't you know, Uncle?"</said> said
               Caspian. <said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz">"When everything was quite
                  different. When all the animals could talk, and there were nice people who lived
                  in the streams and the trees. Naiads and Dryads they were called. And there were
                  Dwarfs. And there were lovely little Fauns in all the woods. They had feet like
                  goats. And----"</said></p>
            <p><said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"That's all nonsense, for babies,"</said>
               said the King sternly. <said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Only fit for
                  babies, do you hear? You're getting too old for that sort of stuff. At your age
                  you ought to be thinking of battles and adventures, not fairy tales."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz">"Oh, but there <emph rend="italic"
                     >were</emph> battles and adventures in those days,"</said> said Caspian. <said
                  who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz">"Wonderful adventures. Once there was a White
                  Witch and she made herself Queen of the whole country. And she made it so that it
                  was always winter. And then two boys and two girls came from somewhere and so they
                  killed the Witch and they were made Kings and Queens of Narnia, and their names
                  were Peter and Susan and Edmund and Lucy. And so they reigned for ever so long and
                  everyone had a lovely time, and it was all because of Aslan----"</said></p>
            <p><said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Who's he?"</said> said Miraz. And if
               Caspian had been a very little older, the tone of his uncle's voice would have warned
               him that it would be wiser to shut up. But he babbled on, <said who="pc" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="miraz">"Oh, don't you know?"</said> he said. <said who="pc" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="miraz">"Aslan is the great Lion who comes from over the sea."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz">"Who has been telling you all this
                  nonsense?"</said> said the King in a voice of thunder.</p>
            <p>Caspian was frightened and said nothing.</p>
            <p><said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Your Royal Highness,"</said> said King
               Miraz, letting go of Caspian's hand, which he had been holding till now, <said
                  who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"I insist upon being answered. Look me in the
                  face. Who has been telling you this pack of lies?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz">"N--Nurse,"</said> faltered Caspian, and
               burst into tears.</p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz">"Stop that noise,"</said> said his uncle,
               taking Caspian by the shoulders and giving him a shake. <said who="miraz"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Stop it. And never let me catch you talking--or <emph
                     rend="italic">thinking</emph> either--about all those silly stories again.
                  There never were those Kings and Queens. How could there be two Kings at the same
                  time? And there's no such person as Aslan. And there are no such things as lions.
                  And there never was a time when animals could talk. Do you hear?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz">"Yes, Uncle,"</said> sobbed Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Then let's have no more of it,"</said>
               said the King. Then he called to one of the gentlemen-in-waiting who were standing at
               the far end of the terrace and said in a cold voice, <said who="miraz" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="mirazgiw">"Conduct His Royal Highness to his apartments and send His Royal
                  Highness's nurse to me AT ONCE."</said></p>
            <p> Next day Caspian found what a terrible thing he had done, for Nurse had been sent
               away without even being allowed to say good-bye to him, and he was told he was to
               have a Tutor.</p>
            <p>Caspian missed his nurse very much and shed many tears; and because he was so
               miserable, he thought about the old stories of Narnia far more than before. He
               dreamed of Dwarfs and Dryads every night and tried very hard to make the dogs and
               cats in the castle talk to him. But the dogs only wagged their tails and the cats
               only purred.</p>
            <p>Caspian felt sure that he would hate the new Tutor, but when the new Tutor arrived
               about a week later he turned out to be the sort of person it is almost impossible not
               to like. He was the smallest, and also the fattest, man Caspian had ever seen. He had
               a long, silvery, pointed beard which came down to his waist, and his face, which was
               brown and covered with wrinkles, looked very wise, very ugly, and very kind. His
               voice was grave and his eyes were merry so that, until you got to know him really
               well, it was hard to know when he was joking and when he was serious. His name was
               Doctor Cornelius.</p>
            <p>Of all his lessons with Doctor Cornelius the one that Caspian liked best was History.
               Up till now, except for Nurse's stories, he had known nothing about the History of
               Narnia, and he was very surprised to learn that the royal family were newcomers in
               the country.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"It was your Highness's ancestor, Caspian
                  the First,"</said> said Doctor Cornelius, <said who="drcorn" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pc">"who first conquered Narnia and made it his kingdom. It was he who
                  brought all your nation into the country. You are not native Narnians at all. You
                  are all Telmarines--that is, you all came from the Land of Telmar, far beyond the
                  Western Mountains. That is why Caspian the First is called Caspian the
                  Conqueror."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Please, Doctor,"</said> asked Caspian
               one day, <said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"who lived in Narnia before we
                  all came here out of Telmar?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"No men--or very few--lived in Narnia
                  before the Telmarines took it,"</said> said Doctor Cornelius.</p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Then who did my great-great-grandcesters
                  conquer?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"<emph rend="italic">Whom</emph>, not
                     <emph rend="italic">who</emph>, your Highness,"</said> said Doctor Cornelius.
                  <said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Perhaps it is time to turn from
                  History to Grammar."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Oh please, not yet,"</said> said
               Caspian. <said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"I mean, wasn't there a battle?
                  Why is he called Caspian the Conqueror if there was nobody here to fight with
                  him?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"I said there were very few <emph
                     rend="italic">men</emph> in Narnia,"</said> said the Doctor, looking at the
               little boy very strangely through his great spectacles.</p>
            <p>For a moment Caspian was puzzled and then suddenly his heart gave a leap. <said
                  who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Do you mean,"</said> he gasped, <said
                  who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"that there were other things? Do you mean
                  it was like in the stories? Were there----?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Hush!"</said> said Doctor Cornelius,
               laying his head very close to Caspian's. <said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc"
                  >"Not a word more. Don't you know your nurse was sent away for telling you about
                  Old Narnia? The King doesn't like it. If he found me telling you secrets, you'd be
                  whipped and I should have my head cut off."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"But why?"</said> asked Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"It is high time we turned to Grammar
                  now,"</said> said Doctor Cornelius, in a loud voice. <said who="drcorn"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Will your Royal Highness be pleased to open
                  Pulverulentus Siccus at the fourth page of his <emph rend="italic">Grammatical
                     Garden or the Arbour of Accidence pleasantlie open'd to Tender
                  Wits</emph>?"</said></p>
            <p>After that it was all nouns and verbs till lunchtime, but I don't think Caspian
               learned much. He was too excited. He felt sure that Doctor Cornelius would not have
               said so much unless he meant to tell him more sooner or later.</p>
            <p>In this he was not disappointed. A few days later his Tutor said, <said who="drcorn"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"To-night I am going to give you a lesson in Astronomy.
                  At dead of night two noble planets, Tarva and Alambil, will pass within one degree
                  of each other. Such a conjunction has not occurred for two hundred years, and your
                  Highness will not live to see it again. It will be best if you go to bed a little
                  earlier than usual. When the time of the conjunction draws near I will come and
                  wake you."</said></p>
            <p>This didn't seem to have anything to do with Old Narnia, which was what Caspian
               really wanted to hear about, but getting up in the middle of the night is always
               interesting and he was moderately pleased. When he went to bed that night, he thought
               at first that he would not be able to sleep; but he soon dropped off and it seemed
               only a few minutes before he felt someone gently shaking him.</p>
            <p>He sat up in bed and saw that the room was full of moonlight. Doctor Cornelius,
               muffled in a hooded robe and holding a small lamp in his hand, stood by the bedside.
               Caspian remembered at once what they were going to do. He got up and put on some
               clothes. Although it was a summer night he felt colder than he had expected and was
               quite glad when the Doctor wrapped him in a robe like his own and gave him a pair of
               warm, soft buskins for his feet. A moment later, both muffled so that they could
               hardly be seen in the dark corridors, and both shod so that they made almost no
               noise, master and pupil left the room.</p>
            <p>Caspian followed the Doctor through many passages and up several staircases, and at
               last, through a little door in a turret, they came out upon the leads. On one side
               were the battlements, on the other a steep roof; below them, all shadowy and
               shimmery, the castle gardens; above them, stars and moon. Presently they came to
               another door, which led into the great central tower of the whole castle: Doctor
               Cornelius unlocked it and they began to climb the dark winding stair of the tower.
               Caspian was becoming excited; he had never been allowed up this stair before.</p>
            <p>It was long and steep, but when they came out on the roof of the tower and Caspian
               had got his breath, he felt that it had been well worth it. Away on his right he
               could see, rather indistinctly, the Western Mountains. On his left was the gleam of
               the Great River, and everything was so quiet that he could hear the sound of the
               waterfall at Beaversdam, a mile away. There was no difficulty in picking out the two
               stars they had come to see. They hung rather low in the southern sky, almost as
               bright as two little moons and very close together.</p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Are they going to have a
                  collision?"</said> he asked in an awe-struck voice.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Nay, dear Prince,"</said> said the
               Doctor (and he too spoke in a whisper). <said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc"
                  >"The great lords of the upper sky know the steps of their dance too well for
                  that. Look well upon them. Their meeting is fortunate and means some great good
                  for the sad realm of Narnia. Tarva, the Lord of Victory, salutes Alambil, the Lady
                  of Peace. They are just coming to their nearest."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"It's a pity that tree gets in the
                  way,"</said> said Caspian. <said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"We'd
                  really see better from the West Tower, though it is not so high."</said></p>
            <p>Doctor Cornelius said nothing for about two minutes, but stood still with his eyes
               fixed on Tarva and Alambil. Then he drew a deep breath and turned to Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"There,"</said> he said. <said
                  who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"You have seen what no man now alive has
                  seen, nor will see again. And you are right. We should have seen it even better
                  from the smaller tower. I brought you here for another reason."</said></p>
            <p>Caspian looked up at him, but the Doctor's hood concealed most of his face.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"The virtue of this tower,"</said> said
               Doctor Cornelius, <said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"is that we have six
                  empty rooms beneath us, and a long stair, and the door at the bottom of the stair
                  is locked. We cannot be overheard."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Are you going to tell me what you
                  wouldn't tell me the other day?"</said> said Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"I am,"</said> said the Doctor. <said
                  who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"But remember. You and I must never talk
                  about these things except here--on the very top of the Great Tower."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"No. That's a promise,"</said> said
               Caspian. <said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"But do go on
               please."</said></p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Listen,"</said> said the Doctor. <said
                  who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"All you have heard about Old Narnia is
                  true. It is not the land of Men. It is the country of Aslan, the country of the
                  Waking Trees and Visible Naiads, of Fauns and Satyrs, of Dwarfs and Giants, of the
                  gods and the Centaurs, of Talking Beasts. It was against these that the first
                  Caspian fought. It is you Telmarines who silenced the beasts and the trees and the
                  fountains, and who killed and drove away the Dwarfs and Fauns, and are now trying
                  to cover up even the memory of them. The King does not allow them to be spoken
                  of."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Oh, I do wish we hadn't,"</said> said
               Caspian. <said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"And I <emph rend="italic"
                     >am</emph> glad it was all true, even if it is all over."</said></p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Many of your race wish that in
                  secret,"</said> said Doctor Cornelius.</p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"But, Doctor,"</said> said Caspian, <said
                  who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"why do you say <emph rend="italic"
                     >my</emph> race? After all, I suppose you're a Telmarine too."</said></p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Am I?"</said> said the Doctor.</p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Well, you're a Man anyway,"</said> said
               Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Am I?"</said> repeated the Doctor in a
               deeper voice, at the same moment throwing back his hood so that Caspian could see his
               face clearly in the moonlight.</p>
            <p>All at once Caspian realised the truth and felt that he ought to have realised it
               long before. Doctor Cornelius was so small, and so fat, and had such a very long
               beard. Two thoughts came into his head at the same moment. One was a thought of
                  terror--<said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"He's not a real man, not a
                  man at all, he's a <emph rend="italic">Dwarf</emph>, and he's brought me up here
                  to kill me." The other was sheer delight--"There are real Dwarfs still, and I've
                  seen one at last."</said></p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"So you've guessed it in the end,"</said>
               said Doctor Cornelius. <said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Or guessed it
                  nearly right. I'm not a pure Dwarf. I have human blood in me too. Many Dwarfs
                  escaped in the great battles and lived on, shaving their beards and wearing
                  high-heeled shoes and pretending to be men. They have mixed with your Telmarines.
                  I am one of those, only a half-Dwarf, and if any of my kindred, the true Dwarfs,
                  are still alive anywhere in the world, doubtless they would despise me and call me
                  a traitor. But never in all these years have we forgotten our own people and all
                  the other happy creatures of Narnia, and the long-lost days of
               freedom."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"I'm--I'm sorry, Doctor,"</said> said
               Caspian. <said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"It wasn't my fault, you
                  know."</said></p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"I am not saying these things in blame of
                  you, dear Prince,"</said> answered the Doctor. <said who="drcorn" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pc">"You may well ask why I say them at all. But I have two reasons.
                  Firstly, because my old heart has carried these secret memories so long that it
                  aches with them and would burst if I did not whisper them to you. But secondly,
                  for this: that when you become King you may help us, for I know that you also,
                  Telmarine though you are, love the Old Things."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"I do, I do,"</said> said Caspian. <said
                  who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"But how can I help?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"You can be kind to the poor remnants of
                  the Dwarf people, like myself. You can gather learned magicians and try to find a
                  way of awaking the trees once more. You can search through all the nooks and wild
                  places of the land to see if any Fauns or Talking Beasts or Dwarfs are perhaps
                  still alive in hiding."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Do you think there are any?"</said>
               asked Caspian eagerly.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"I don't know--I don't know,"</said> said
               the Doctor with a deep sigh. <said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Sometimes I
                  am afraid there can't be. I have been looking for traces of them all my life.
                  Sometimes I have thought I heard a Dwarf-drum in the mountains. Sometimes at
                  night, in the woods, I thought I had caught a glimpse of Fauns and Satyrs dancing
                  a long way off; but when I came to the place, there was never anything there. I
                  have often despaired; but something always happens to start me hoping again. I
                  don't know. But at least you can try to be a King like the High King Peter of old,
                  and not like your uncle."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Then it's true about the Kings and
                  Queens too, and about the White Witch?"</said> said Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Certainly it is true,"</said> said
               Cornelius. <said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Their reign was the Golden
                  Age in Narnia and the land has never forgotten them."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Did they live in this castle,
                  Doctor?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Nay, my dear,"</said> said the old man.
                  <said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"This castle is a thing of yesterday.
                  Your great-great-grandfather built it. But when the two sons of Adam and the two
                  daughters of Eve were made Kings and Queens of Narnia by Aslan himself, they lived
                  in the castle of Cair Paravel. No man alive has seen that blessed place and
                  perhaps even the ruins of it have now vanished. But we believe it was far from
                  here, down at the mouth of the Great River, on the very shore of the
               sea."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Ugh!"</said> said Caspian with a
               shudder. <said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Do you mean in the Black Woods?
                  Where all the--the--you know, the ghosts live?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Your Highness speaks as you have been
                  taught,"</said> said the Doctor. <said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"But
                  it is all lies. There are no ghosts there. That is a story invented by the
                  Telmarines. Your Kings are in deadly fear of the sea because they can never quite
                  forget that in all stories Aslan comes from over the sea. They don't want to go
                  near it and they don't want anyone else to go near it. So they have let great
                  woods grow up to cut their people off from the coast. But because they have
                  quarrelled with the trees they are afraid of the woods. And because they are
                  afraid of the woods they imagine that they are full of ghosts. And the Kings and
                  great men, hating both the sea and the wood, partly believe these stories, and
                  partly encourage them. They feel safer if no one in Narnia dares to go down to the
                  coast and look out to sea--towards Aslan's land and the morning and the eastern
                  end of the world."</said></p>
            <p>There was a deep silence between them for a few minutes. Then Doctor Cornelius said,
                  <said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Come. We have been here long enough.
                  It is time to go down and to bed."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Must we?"</said> said Caspian. <said
                  who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"I'd like to go on talking about these
                  things for hours and hours and hours."</said></p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Someone might begin looking for us, if
                  we did that,"</said> said Doctor Cornelius.</p>

            <head>Caspian's Adventure in the Mountains</head>
            <p>After this, Caspian and his Tutor had many more secret conversations on the top of
               the Great Tower, and at each conversation Caspian learned more about Old Narnia, so
               that thinking and dreaming about the old days, and longing that they might come back,
               filled nearly all his spare hours. But of course he had not many hours to spare, for
               now his education was beginning in earnest. He learned sword-fighting and riding,
               swimming and diving, how to shoot with the bow and play on the recorder and the
               theorbo, how to hunt the stag and cut him up when he was dead, besides Cosmography,
               Rhetoric, Heraldry, Versification, and of course History, with a little Law, Physic,
               Alchemy and Astronomy. Of Magic he learned only the theory, for Doctor Cornelius said
               the practical part was not a proper study for princes. <said who="drcorn"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"And I myself,"</said> he added, <said who="drcorn"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"am only a very imperfect magician and can do only the
                  smallest experiments."</said> Of Navigation (<said who="drcorn" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pc">"Which is a noble and heroical art,"</said> said the Doctor) he was
               taught nothing, because King Miraz disapproved of ships and the sea.</p>
            <p>He also learned a great deal by using his own eyes and ears. As a little boy he had
               often wondered why he disliked his aunt, Queen Prunaprismia; he now saw that it was
               because she disliked him. He also began to see that Narnia was an unhappy country.
               The taxes were high and the laws were stern and Miraz was a cruel man.</p>
            <p>After some years there came a time when the Queen seemed to be ill and there was a
               great deal of bustle and pother about her in the castle and doctors came and the
               courtiers whispered. This was in early summertime. And one night, while all this fuss
               was going on, Caspian was unexpectedly wakened by Doctor Cornelius after he had been
               only a few hours in bed.</p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Are we going to do a little Astronomy,
                  Doctor?"</said> said Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Hush!"</said> said the Doctor. <said
                  who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Trust me and do exactly as I tell you. Put
                  on all your clothes; you have a long journey before you."</said></p>
            <p>Caspian was very surprised, but he had learned to have confidence in his Tutor and he
               began doing what he was told at once. When he was dressed the Doctor said, <said
                  who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"I have a wallet for you. We must go into
                  the next room and fill it with victuals from your Highness's supper
               table."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"My gentlemen-in-waiting will be
                  there,"</said> said Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"They are fast asleep and will not wake,"
                  said the Doctor. "I am a very minor magician but I can at least contrive a charmed
                  sleep."</said></p>
            <p>They went into the antechamber and there, sure enough, the two gentlemen-in-waiting
               were, sprawling on chairs and snoring hard. Doctor Cornelius quickly cut up the
               remains of a cold chicken and some slices of venison and put them, with bread and an
               apple or so and a little flask of good wine, into the wallet which he then gave to
               Caspian. It fitted on by a strap over Caspian's shoulder, like a satchel you would
               use for taking books to school.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Have you your sword?"</said> asked the
               Doctor.</p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Yes,"</said> said Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Then put this mantle over all to hide
                  the sword and the wallet. That's right. And now we must go to the Great Tower and
                  talk."</said></p>
            <p>When they had reached the top of the Tower (it was a cloudy night, not at all like
               the night when they had seen the conjunction of Tarva and Alambil) Doctor Cornelius
               said,</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Dear Prince, you must leave this castle
                  at once and go to seek your fortune in the wide world. Your life is in danger
                  here."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Why?"</said> asked Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Because you are the true King of Narnia:
                  Caspian the Tenth, the true son and heir of Caspian the Ninth. Long life to your
                  Majesty"</said>--and suddenly, to Caspian's great surprise, the little man dropped
               down on one knee and kissed his hand.</p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"What does it all mean? I don't
                  understand,"</said> said Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"I wonder you have never asked me
                  before,"</said> said the Doctor, <said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"why,
                  being the son of King Caspian, you are not King Caspian yourself. Everyone except
                  your Majesty knows that Miraz is a usurper. When he first began to rule he did not
                  even pretend to be the King: he called himself Lord Protector. But then your royal
                  mother died, the good Queen and the only Telmarine who was ever kind to me. And
                  then, one by one, all the great lords, who had known your father, died or
                  disappeared. Not by accident, either. Miraz weeded them out. Belisar and Uvilas
                  were shot with arrows on a hunting party: by chance, it was pretended. All the
                  great house of the Passarids he sent to fight giants on the northern frontier till
                  one by one they fell. Arlian and Erimon and a dozen more he executed for treason
                  on a false charge. The two brothers of Beaversdam he shut up as madmen. And
                  finally he persuaded the seven noble lords, who alone among all the Telmarines did
                  not fear the sea, to sail away and look for new lands beyond the Eastern Ocean,
                  and, as he intended, they never came back. And when there was no one left who
                  could speak a word for you, then his flatterers (as he had instructed them) begged
                  him to become King. And of course he did."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Do you mean he now wants to kill me
                  too?"</said> said Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"That is almost certain,"</said> said
               Doctor Cornelius.</p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"But why now?"</said> said Caspian. <said
                  who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"I mean, why didn't he do it long ago if he
                  wanted to? And what harm have I done him?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"He has changed his mind about you
                  because of something that happened only two hours ago. The Queen has had a
                  son."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"I don't see what that's got to do with
                  it,"</said> said Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Don't see!"</said> exclaimed the Doctor.
                  <said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Have all my lessons in History and
                  Politics taught you no more than that? Listen. As long as he had no children of
                  his own, he was willing enough that you should be King after he died. He may not
                  have cared much about you, but he would rather you should have the throne than a
                  stranger. Now that he has a son of his own he will want his own son to be the next
                  King. You are in the way. He'll clear you out of the way."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Is he really as bad as that?"</said>
               said Caspian. <said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Would he really murder
                  me?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"He murdered your Father,"</said> said
               Doctor Cornelius.</p>
            <p>Caspian felt very queer and said nothing.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"I can tell you the whole story,"</said>
               said the Doctor. <said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"But not now. There is
                  no time. You must fly at once."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"You'll come with me?"</said> said
               Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"I dare not,"</said> said the Doctor.
                  <said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"It would make your danger greater.
                  Two are more easily tracked than one. Dear Prince, dear King Caspian, you must be
                  very brave. You must go alone and at once. Try to get across the southern border
                  to the court of King Nain of Archenland. He will be good to you."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Shall I never see you again?"</said>
               said Caspian in a quavering voice.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"I hope so, dear King,"</said> said the
               Doctor. <said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"What friend have I in the wide
                  world except your Majesty? And I have a little magic. But in the meantime, speed
                  is everything. Here are two gifts before you go. This is a little purse of
                  gold--alas, all the treasure in this castle should be your own by rights. And here
                  is something far better."</said></p>
            <p>He put in Caspian's hands something which he could hardly see but which he knew by
               the feel to be a horn.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"That,"</said> said Doctor Cornelius,
                  <said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"is the greatest and most sacred
                  treasure of Narnia. Many terrors I endured, many spells did I utter, to find it,
                  when I was still young. It is the magic horn of Queen Susan herself which she left
                  behind her when she vanished from Narnia at the end of the Golden Age. It is said
                  that whoever blows it shall have strange help--no one can say how strange. It may
                  have power to call Queen Lucy and King Edmund and Queen Susan and the High King
                  Peter back from the past, and they will set all to rights. It may be that it will
                  call up Aslan himself. Take it, King Caspian: but do not use it except at your
                  greatest need. And now, haste, haste, haste. The little door at the very bottom of
                  the Tower, the door into the garden, is unlocked. There we must part."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Can't I get my horse Destrier?"</said>
               said Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"He is already saddled and waiting for
                  you just at the corner of the orchard."</said></p>
            <p>During the long climb down the winding staircase Cornelius whispered many more words
               of direction and advice. Caspian's heart was sinking, but he tried to take it all in.
               Then came the fresh air in the garden, a fervent handclasp with the Doctor, a run
               across the lawn, a welcoming whinny from Destrier, and so King Caspian the Tenth left
               the castle of his fathers. Looking back, he saw fireworks going up to celebrate the
               birth of the new prince.</p>
            <p>All night he rode southward, choosing by-ways and bridle paths through woods as long
               as he was in country that he knew; but afterwards he kept to the high road. Destrier
               was as excited as his master at this unusual journey, and Caspian, though tears had
               come into his eyes at saying good-bye to Doctor Cornelius, felt brave and, in a way,
               happy, to think that he was King Caspian riding to seek adventures, with his sword on
               his left hip and Queen Susan's magic horn on his right. But when day came, with a
               sprinkle of rain, and he looked about him and saw on every side unknown woods, wild
               heaths and blue mountains, he thought how large and strange the world was and felt
               frightened and small.</p>
            <p>As soon as it was full daylight he left the road and found an open grassy place amid
               a wood where he could rest. He took off Destrier's bridle and let him graze, ate some
               cold chicken and drank a little wine, and presently fell asleep. It was late
               afternoon when he awoke. He ate a morsel and continued his journey, still southward,
               by many unfrequented lanes. He was now in a land of hills, going up and down, but
               always more up than down. From every ridge he could see the mountains growing bigger
               and blacker ahead. As the evening closed in, he was riding their lower slopes. The
               wind rose. Soon rain fell in torrents. Destrier became uneasy; there was thunder in
               the air. And now they entered a dark and seemingly endless pine forest, and all the
               stories Caspian had ever heard of trees being unfriendly to Man crowded into his
               mind. He remembered that he was, after all, a Telmarine, one of the race who cut down
               trees wherever they could and were at war with all wild things; and though he himself
               might be unlike other Telmarines, the trees could not be expected to know this.</p>
            <p>Nor did they. The wind became a tempest, the woods roared and creaked all round him.
               There came a crash. A tree fell right across the road just behind him. "Quiet,
               Destrier, quiet!" said Caspian, patting his horse's neck; but he was trembling
               himself and knew that he had escaped death by an inch. Lightning flashed and a great
               crack of thunder seemed to break the sky in two just overhead. Destrier bolted in
               good earnest. Caspian was a good rider, but he had not the strength to hold him back.
               He kept his seat, but he knew that his life hung by a thread during the wild career
               that followed. Tree after tree rose up before them in the dusk and was only just
               avoided. Then, almost too suddenly to hurt (and yet it did hurt him too) something
               struck Caspian on the forehead and he knew no more.</p>
            <p> When he came to himself he was lying in a firelit place with bruised limbs and a bad
               headache. Low voices were speaking close at hand.</p>
            <p><said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin nikabrik">"And now,"</said>
               said one, <said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin nikabrik">"before
                  it wakes up we must decide what to do with it."</said></p>
            <p><said who="nikabrik" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin trufflehunter">"Kill it,"</said>
               said another. <said who="nikabrik" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin trufflehunter">"We
                  can't let it live. It would betray us."</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="trufflehunter nikabrik">"We ought to have
                  killed it at once, or else let it alone," said a third voice. "We can't kill it
                  now. Not after we've taken it in and bandaged its head and all. It would be
                  murdering a guest."</said></p>
            <p><said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin nikabrik">"Gentlemen,"</said>
               said Caspian in a feeble voice, <said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="trumpkin nikabrik">"whatever you do to me, I hope you will be kind to my
                  poor horse."</said></p>
            <p>"Your horse had taken flight long before we found you," said the first voice--a
               curiously husky, earthy voice, as Caspian now noticed.</p>
            <p>"Now don't let it talk you round with its pretty words," said the second voice. "I
               still say----"</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="trufflehunter nikabrik">"Horns and
                  halibuts!"</said> exclaimed the third voice. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="trufflehunter nikabrik">"Of course we're not going to murder it. For
                  shame, Nikabrik. What do you say, Trufflehunter? What shall we do with
               it?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin nikabrik">"I shall give it a
                  drink,"</said> said the first voice, presumably Trufflehunter's. A dark shape
               approached the bed. Caspian felt an arm slipped gently under his shoulders--if it was
               exactly an arm. The shape somehow seemed wrong. The face that bent towards him seemed
               wrong too. He got the impression that it was very hairy and very long nosed, and
               there were odd white patches on each side of it. <said who="pc" aloud="false">"It's a
                  mask of some sort,"</said> thought Caspian. <said who="pc" aloud="false">"Or
                  perhaps I'm in a fever and imagining it all."</said> A cupful of something sweet
               and hot was set to his lips and he drank. At that moment one of the others poked the
               fire. A blaze sprang up and Caspian almost screamed with the shock as the sudden
               light revealed the face that was looking into his own. It was not a man's face but a
               badger's, though larger and friendlier and more intelligent than the face of any
               badger he had seen before. And it had certainly been talking. He saw, too, that he
               was on a bed of heather, in a cave. By the fire sat two little bearded men, so much
               wilder and shorter and hairier and thicker than Doctor Cornelius that he knew them at
               once for real Dwarfs, ancient Dwarfs with not a drop of human blood in their veins.
               And Caspian knew that he had found the Old Narnians at last. Then his head began to
               swim again.</p>
            <p>In the next few days he learned to know them by names. The Badger was called
               Trufflehunter; he was the oldest and kindest of the three. The Dwarf who had wanted
               to kill Caspian was a sour Black Dwarf (that is, his hair and beard were black, and
               thick and hard like horse-hair). His name was Nikabrik. The other Dwarf was a Red
               Dwarf with hair rather like a Fox's and he was called Trumpkin.</p>
            <p><said who="nikabrik" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin trufflehunter">"And now,"</said>
               said Nikabrik on the first evening when Caspian was well enough to sit up and talk,
                  <said who="nikabrik" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin trufflehunter">"we still have
                  to decide what to do with this Human. You two think you've done it a great
                  kindness by not letting me kill it. But I suppose the upshot is that we have to
                  keep it a prisoner for life. I'm certainly not going to let it go alive--to go
                  back to its own kind and betray us all."</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="nikabrik">"Bulbs and bolsters!

            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin trufflehunter nikabrik">"I say,"</said>

            <p><said who="nikabrik" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"That's a likely story,"</said> growled
               Nikabrik. <said who="nikabrik" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"You're a Telmarine and a

            <p><said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Well now,"</said> said

            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"He's my uncle,"</said> began Caspian,

               <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">Are you still mad enough to let this
                  creature live?"</said> He would have stabbed Caspian then and there, if the Badger
               and Trumpkin had not got in the way and forced him back to his seat and held him
               down.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="nikabrik">"Now, once and for all,

            <p>Nikabrik sulkily promised to behave, and the other two asked Caspian to tell his
               whole story. When he had done so there was a moment's silence.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="trufflehunter nikabrik pc">"This is the

                  Sometimes I did wonder if there really was such a person as Aslan: but then

                  us than the half-Dwarfs are from you."</said></p>
            <p>There was a great deal more talk, but it all ended with the agreement that Caspian
               should stay and even the promise that, as soon as he was able to go out, he should be
               taken to see what Trumpkin called "the Others"; for apparently in these wild parts
               all sorts of creatures from the Old Days of Narnia still lived on in hiding.</p>

         <div type="chapter" n="6">
            <head>The People That Lived in Hiding</head>
            <p>Now began the happiest times that Caspian had ever known. On a fine summer morning
               when the dew lay on the grass he set off with the Badger and the two Dwarfs, up
               through the forest to a high saddle in the mountains and down on to their sunny
               southern slopes where one looked across the green wolds of Archenland.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"We will go first to the Three Bulgy
                  Bears,"</said> said Trumpkin.</p>
            <p>They came in a glade to an old hollow oak tree covered with moss, and Trufflehunter
               tapped with his paw three times on the trunk and there was no answer. Then he tapped
               again and a woolly sort of voice from inside said, <said who="3bbs" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pc">"Go away. It's not time to get up yet."</said> But when he tapped the
               third time there was a noise like a small earthquake from inside and a sort of door
               opened and out came three brown bears, very bulgy indeed and blinking their little
               eyes. And when everything had been explained to them (which took a long time because
               they were so sleepy) they said, just as Trufflehunter had said, that a son of Adam
               ought to be King of Narnia and all kissed Caspian--very wet, snuffly kisses they
               were--and offered him some honey. Caspian did not really want honey, without bread,
               at that time in the morning, but he thought it polite to accept. It took him a long
               time afterwards to get unsticky.</p>
            <p>After that they went on till they came among tall beech trees and Trufflehunter
               called out, <said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true" toWhom="pattertwig">"Pattertwig!
                  Pattertwig! Pattertwig!"</said> and almost at once, bounding down from branch to
               branch till he was just above their heads, came the most magnificent red squirrel
               that Caspian had ever seen. He was far bigger than the ordinary dumb squirrels which
               he had sometimes seen in the castle gardens; indeed he was nearly the size of a
               terrier and the moment you looked in his face you saw that he could talk. Indeed the
               difficulty was to get him to stop talking, for, like all squirrels, he was a
               chatterer. He welcomed Caspian at once and asked if he would like a nut and Caspian
               said thanks, he would. But as Pattertwig went bounding away to fetch it,
               Trufflehunter whispered in Caspian's ear, <said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pc">"Don't look. Look the other way. It's very bad manners among squirrels
                  to watch anyone going to his store or to look as if you wanted to know where it
                  was."</said> Then Pattertwig came back with the nut and Caspian ate it and after
               that Pattertwig asked if he could take any messages to other friends. <said
                  who="pattertwig" aloud="true" toWhom="trufflehunter trumpkin nikabrik">"For I can
                  go nearly everywhere without setting foot to ground,"</said> he said.
               Trufflehunter and the Dwarfs thought this a very good idea and gave Pattertwig
               messages to all sorts of people with queer names telling them all to come to a feast
               and council on Dancing Lawn at midnight three nights ahead. <said who="trumpkin"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="pattertwig">"And you'd better tell the three Bulgies
                  too,"</said> added Trumpkin. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pattertwig"
                  >"We forgot to mention it to them."</said></p>
            <p>Their next visit was to the Seven Brothers of Shuddering Wood. Trumpkin led the way
               back to the saddle and then down eastward on the northern slope of the mountains till
               they came to a very solemn place among rocks and fir trees. They went very quietly
               and presently Caspian could feel the ground shake under his feet as if someone were
               hammering down below. Trumpkin went to a flat stone about the size of the top of a
               water-butt, and stamped on it with his foot. After a long pause it was moved away by
               someone or something underneath, and there was a dark, round hole with a good deal of
               heat and steam coming out of it and in the middle of the hole the head of a Dwarf
               very like Trumpkin himself. There was a long talk here and the Dwarf seemed more
               suspicious than the Squirrel or the Bulgy Bears had been, but in the end the whole
               party were invited to come down. Caspian found himself descending a dark stairway
               into the earth, but when he came to the bottom he saw firelight. It was the light of
               a furnace. The whole place was a smithy. A subterranean stream ran past on one side
               of it. Two Dwarfs were at the bellows, another was holding a piece of red-hot metal
               on the anvil with a pair of tongs, a fourth was hammering it, and two, wiping their
               horny little hands on a greasy cloth, were coming forward to meet the visitors. It
               took some time to satisfy them that Caspian was a friend and not an enemy, but when
               they did, they all cried, <said who="reddwarves" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Long live
                  the King,"</said> and their gifts were noble--mail shirts and helmets and swords
               for Caspian and Trumpkin and Nikabrik. The Badger could have had the same if he had
               liked, but he said he was a beast, he was, and if his claws and teeth could not keep
               his skin whole, it wasn't worth keeping. The workmanship of the arms was far finer
               than any Caspian had ever seen, and he gladly accepted the Dwarf-made sword instead
               of his own, which looked, in comparison, as feeble as a toy and as clumsy as a stick.
               The seven brothers (who were all Red Dwarfs) promised to come to the feast at Dancing
               Lawn.</p>
            <p>A little farther on, in a dry, rocky ravine they reached the cave of five Black
               Dwarfs. They looked suspiciously at Caspian, but in the end the eldest of them said,
                  <said who="blackdwarves" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"If he is against Miraz, we'll
                  have him for King."</said> And the next oldest said, <said who="blackdwarves"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="trufflehunter nikabrik trumpkin pc">"Shall we go farther up
                  for you, up to the crags? There's an Ogre or two and a Hag that we could introduce
                  you to, up there."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="blackdwarves">"Certainly not,"</said> said
               Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true" toWhom="blackdwarves">"I should think not,
                  indeed,"</said> said Trufflehunter. <said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="blackdwarves">"We want none of that sort on our side."</said> Nikabrik
               disagreed with this, but Trumpkin and the Badger overruled him. It gave Caspian a
               shock to realise that the horrible creatures out of the old stories, as well as the
               nice ones, had some descendants in Narnia still.</p>
            <p><said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true" toWhom="trufflehunter nikabrik pc">"We should
                  not have Aslan for our friend if we brought in that rabble,"</said> said
               Trufflehunter as they came away from the cave of the Black Dwarfs.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="trufflehunter pc  nikabrik">"Oh,
                  Aslan!"</said> said Trumpkin, cheerily but contemptuously. <said who="trumpkin"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="trufflehunter nikabrik pc">"What matters much more is that
                  you wouldn't have me."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="nikabrik">"Do you believe in Aslan?"</said> said
               Caspian to Nikabrik.</p>
            <p><said who="nikabrik" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"I'll believe in anyone or
                  anything,"</said> said Nikabrik, <said who="nikabrik" aloud="true" toWhom="pc"
                  >"that'll batter these cursed Telmarine barbarians to pieces or drive them out of
                  Narnia. Anyone or anything, Aslan <emph rend="italic">or</emph> the White Witch,
                  do you understand?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true" toWhom="nikabrik">"Silence, silence,"</said>
               said Trufflehunter. <said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true" toWhom="nikabrik">"You do
                  not know what you are saying. She was a worse enemy than Miraz and all his
                  race."</said></p>
            <p><said who="nikabrik" aloud="true" toWhom="trufflehunter">"Not to Dwarfs, she
                  wasn't,"</said> said Nikabrik.</p>
            <p>Their next visit was a pleasanter one. As they came lower down, the mountains opened
               out into a great glen or wooded gorge with a swift river running at the bottom. The
               open places near the river's edge were a mass of foxgloves and wild roses and the air
               was buzzing with bees. Here Trufflehunter called again, <said who="trufflehunter"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="glenstorm">"Glenstorm! Glenstorm!"</said> and after a pause
               Caspian heard the sound of hoofs. It grew louder till the valley trembled and at
               last, breaking and trampling the thickets, there came in sight the noblest creatures
               that Caspian had yet seen, the great Centaur Glenstorm and his three sons. His flanks
               were glossy chestnut and the beard that covered his broad chest was golden-red. He
               was a prophet and a star-gazer and knew what they had come about.</p>
            <p><said who="glenstorm" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Long live the King,"</said> he cried.
                  <said who="glenstorm" aloud="true" toWhom="trufflehunter trumpkin nikabrik pc">"I
                  and my sons are ready for war. When is the battle to be joined?"</said></p>
            <p>Up till now neither Caspian nor the others had really been thinking of a war. They
               had some vague idea, perhaps, of an occasional raid on some Human farmstead or of
               attacking a party of hunters, if it ventured too far into these southern wilds. But,
               in the main, they had thought only of living to themselves in woods and caves and
               building up an attempt at Old Narnia in hiding. As soon as Glenstorm had spoken
               everyone felt much more serious.</p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="glenstorm">"Do you mean a real war to drive Miraz
                  out of Narnia?"</said> asked Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="glenstorm" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"What else?"</said> said the Centaur.
                  <said who="glenstorm" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Why else does your Majesty go clad
                  in mail and girt with sword?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true" toWhom="glenstorm">"Is it possible,
                  Glenstorm?"</said> said the Badger.</p>
            <p><said who="glenstorm" aloud="true" toWhom="trufflehunter">"The time is ripe,"</said>
               said Glenstorm. <said who="glenstorm" aloud="true" toWhom="trufflehunter">"I watch
                  the skies, Badger, for it is mine to watch, as it is yours to remember. Tarva and
                  Alambil have met in the halls of high heaven, and on earth a son of Adam has once
                  more arisen to rule and name the creatures. The hour has struck. Our council at
                  the Dancing Lawn must be a council of war."</said> He spoke in such a voice that
               neither Caspian nor the others hesitated for a moment: it now seemed to them quite
               possible that they might win a war and quite certain that they must wage one.</p>
            <p>As it was now past the middle of the day, they rested with the Centaurs and ate such
               food as the Centaurs provided--cakes of oaten meal, and apples, and herbs, and wine,
               and cheese.</p>
            <p>The next place they were to visit was quite near at hand, but they had to go a long
               way round in order to avoid a region in which Men lived. It was well into the
               afternoon before they found themselves in level fields, warm between hedgerows. There
               Trufflehunter called at the mouth of a little hole in a green bank and out popped the
               last thing Caspian expected--a Talking Mouse. He was of course bigger than a common
               mouse, well over a foot high when he stood on his hind legs, and with ears nearly as
               long (though broader) than a rabbit's. His name was Reepicheep and he was a gay and
               martial mouse. He wore a tiny little rapier at his side and twirled his long whiskers
               as if they were a moustache. <said who="rcheep" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"There are
                  twelve of us, Sire,"</said> he said with a dashing and graceful bow, <said
                  who="rcheep" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"and I place all the resources of my people
                  unreservedly at your Majesty's disposal."</said> Caspian tried hard (and
               successfully) not to laugh, but he couldn't help thinking that Reepicheep and all his
               people could very easily be put in a washing basket and carried home on one's
               back.</p>
            <p>It would take too long to mention all the creatures whom Caspian met that
               day--Clodsley Shovel the Mole, the three Hardbiters (who were badgers like
               Trufflehunter), Camillo the Hare, and Hogglestock the Hedgehog. They rested at last
               beside a well at the edge of a wide and level circle of grass, bordered with tall
               elms which now threw long shadows across it, for the sun was setting, the daisies
               closing, and the rooks flying home to bed. Here they supped on food they had brought
               with them and Trumpkin lit his pipe (Nikabrik was not a smoker).</p>
            <p><said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin nikabrik pc">"Now,"</said>
               said the Badger, <said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin nikabrik pc"
                  >"if only we could wake the spirits of these trees and this well, we should have
                  done a good day's work."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin nikabrik trufflehunter">"Can't
                  we?"</said> said Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"No,"</said> said Trufflehunter.
                  <said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"We have no power over them.
                  Since the Humans came into the land, felling forests and defiling streams, the
                  Dryads and Naiads have sunk into a deep sleep. Who knows if ever they will stir
                  again? And that is a great loss to our side. The Telmarines are horribly afraid of
                  the woods, and once the Trees moved in anger, our enemies would go mad with fright
                  and be chased out of Narnia as quick as their legs could carry them."</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="trufflehunter">"What imaginations you
                  Animals have!"</said> said Trumpkin, who didn't believe in such things. <said
                  who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="trufflehunter">"But why stop at Trees and
                  Waters? Wouldn't it be even nicer if the stones started throwing themselves at old
                  Miraz?"</said></p>
            <p>The Badger only grunted at this, and after that there was such a silence that Caspian
               had nearly dropped off to sleep when he thought he heard a faint musical sound from
               the depth of the woods at his back. Then he thought it was only a dream and turned
               over again; but as soon as his ear touched the ground he felt or heard (it was hard
               to tell which) a faint beating or drumming. He raised his head. The beating noise at
               once became fainter, but the music returned, clearer this time. It was like flutes.
               He saw that Trufflehunter was sitting up staring into the wood. The moon was bright;
               Caspian had been asleep longer than he thought. Nearer and nearer came the music, a
               tune wild and yet dreamy, and the noise of many light feet, till at last, out from
               the wood into the moonlight, came dancing shapes such as Caspian had been thinking of
               all his life. They were not much taller than Dwarfs, but far slighter and more
               graceful. Their curly heads had little horns, the upper part of their bodies gleamed
               naked in the pale light, but their legs and feet were those of goats.</p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin trufflehunter nikabrik">"Fauns!"</said>
               cried Caspian, jumping up, and in a moment they were all round him. It took next to
               no time to explain the whole situation to them and they accepted Caspian at once.
               Before he knew what he was doing he found himself joining in the dance. Trumpkin,
               with heavier and jerkier movements, did likewise and even Trufflehunter hopped and
               lumbered about as best he could. Only Nikabrik stayed where he was, looking on in
               silence. The Fauns footed it all round Caspian to their reedy pipes. Their strange
               faces, which seemed mournful and merry all at once, looked into his; dozens of Fauns,
               Mentius and Obentinus and Dumnus, Voluns, Voltinus, Girbius, Nimienus, Nausus and
               Oscuns. Pattertwig had sent them all.</p>
            <p>When Caspian awoke next morning he could hardly believe that it had not all been a
               dream; but the grass was covered with little cloven hoof-marks.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="chapter" n="7">
            <head>Old Narnia in Danger</head>
            <p>The place where they had met the Fauns was, of course, Dancing Lawn itself, and here
               Caspian and his friends remained till the night of the Great Council. To sleep under
               the stars, to drink nothing but well water and to live chiefly on nuts and wild
               fruit, was a strange experience for Caspian after his bed with silken sheets in a
               tapestried chamber at the castle, with meals laid out on gold and silver dishes in
               the ante-room, and attendants ready at his call. But he had never enjoyed himself
               more. Never had sleep been more refreshing nor food tasted more savoury, and he began
               already to harden and his face wore a kinglier look.</p>
            <p>When the great night came, and his various strange subjects came stealing into the
               lawn by ones and twos and threes or by sixes and sevens--the moon then shining almost
               at her full--his heart swelled as he saw their numbers and heard their greetings. All
               whom he had met were there: Bulgy Bears and Red Dwarfs and Black Dwarfs, Moles and
               Badgers, Hares and Hedgehogs, and others whom he had not yet seen--five Satyrs as red
               as foxes, the whole contingent of Talking Mice, armed to the teeth and following a
               shrill trumpet, some Owls, the Old Raven of Ravenscaur. Last of all (and this took
               Caspian's breath away), with the Centaurs came a small but genuine Giant,
               Wimbleweather of Deadman's Hill, carrying on his back a basketful of rather sea-sick
               Dwarfs who had accepted his offer of a lift and were now wishing they had walked
               instead.</p>
            <p>The Bulgy Bears were very anxious to have the feast first and leave the council till
               afterwards: perhaps till to-morrow. Reepicheep and his Mice said that councils and
               feasts could both wait, and proposed storming Miraz in his own castle that very
               night. Pattertwig and the other Squirrels said they could talk and eat at the same
               time, so why not have the council and feast all at once? The Moles proposed throwing
               up entrenchments round the Lawn before they did anything else. The Fauns thought it
               would be better to begin with a solemn dance. The Old Raven, while agreeing with the
               Bears that it would take too long to have a full council before supper, begged to be
               allowed to give a brief address to the whole company. But Caspian and the Centaurs
               and the Dwarfs over-ruled all these suggestions and insisted on holding a real
               council of war at once.</p>
            <p>When all the other creatures had been persuaded to sit down quietly in a great
               circle, and when (with more difficulty) they had got Pattertwig to stop running to
               and fro and saying <said who="pattertwig" aloud="true">"Silence! Silence, everyone,
                  for the King's speech,"</said> Caspian, feeling a little nervous, got up. <said
                  who="pc" aloud="true">"Narnians!"</said> he began, but he never got any further,
               for at that very moment Camillo the Hare said, <said who="camillo" aloud="true"
                  >"Hush! There's a Man somewhere near."</said></p>
            <p>They were all creatures of the wild, accustomed to being hunted, and they all became
               still as statues. The beasts all turned their noses in the direction which Camillo
               had indicated.</p>
            <p><said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true" toWhom="camillo">"Smells like Man and yet not

            <p><said who="camillo" aloud="true" toWhom="trufflehunter">"It's getting steadily
                  nearer,"</said> said Camillo.</p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="blackdwarves">"Two badgers and you three Dwarfs,
                  with your bow at the ready, go softly off to meet it,"</said> said Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="blackdwarves" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"We'll settle 'un,"</said> said a
               Black Dwarf grimly, fitting a shaft to his bowstring.</p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="blackdwarves">"Don't shoot if it is
                  alone,"</said> said Caspian. <said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="blackdwarves"
                  >"Catch it."</said></p>
            <p><said who="blackdwarves" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Why?"</said> asked the Dwarf.</p>
            <p><said who="glenstorm" aloud="true" toWhom="blackdwarves">"Do as you're told,"</said>
               said Glenstorm the Centaur.</p>
            <p>Everyone waited in silence while the three Dwarfs and two Badgers trotted stealthily
               across to the trees on the north-west side of the Lawn. Then came a sharp dwarfish
               cry, <said who="blackdwarves" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Stop! Who goes
                  there?"</said> and a sudden spring. A moment later a voice, which Caspian knew
               well, could be heard saying, <said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="blackdwarves"
                  >"All right, all right, I'm unarmed. Take my wrists if you like, worthy Badgers,
                  but don't bite right through them. I want to speak to the King."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Doctor Cornelius!"</said> cried Caspian
               with joy, and rushed forward to greet his old master. Everyone else crowded
               round.</p>
            <p><said who="nikabrik" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Pah!"</said> said Nikabrik. <said

                  having no wish to be questioned about it in Miraz's torture chamber. I had a
                  pretty good guess from my crystal as to where I should find you. But all day--that
                  was the day before yesterday--I saw Miraz's tracking parties out in the woods.
                  Yesterday I learned that his army is out. I don't think some of
                  your--um--pure-blooded Dwarfs have as much woodcraft as might be expected. You've
                  left tracks all over the place. Great carelessness. At any rate something has

                  and of something that may come over the sea. That is why they have let the great
                  woods grow up. If traditions speak true, the ancient Cair Paravel was at the
                  river-mouth. All that part is friendly to us and hateful to our enemies. We must
                  go to Aslan's How."</said></p>

            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true">"It lies within the skirts of the Great Woods and it
                  is a huge mound which Narnians raised in very ancient times over a very magical
                  place, where there stood--and perhaps still stands--a very magical Stone. The
                  Mound is all hollowed out within into galleries and caves, and the Stone is in the
                  central cave of all. There is room in the mound for all our stores, and those of
                  us who have most need of cover and are most accustomed to underground life can be
                  lodged in the caves. The rest of us can lie in the wood. At a pinch all of us
                  (except this worthy Giant) could retreat into the Mound itself, and there we
                  should be beyond the reach of every danger except famine."</said></p>
            <p><said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"It is a good thing we have a
                  learned man among us,"</said> said Trufflehunter; but Trumpkin muttered under his

                  think less about these old wives' tales and more about victuals and arms."</said>
               But all approved of Cornelius's proposal and that very night, half an hour later,
               they were on the march. Before sunrise they arrived at Aslan's How.</p>
            <p>It was certainly an awesome place, a round green hill on top of another hill, long
               since grown over with trees, and one little, low doorway leading into it. The tunnels
               inside were a perfect maze till you got to know them, and they were lined and roofed
               with smooth stones, and on the stones, peering in the twilight, Caspian saw strange
               characters and snaky patterns, and pictures in which the form of a Lion was repeated
               again and again. It all seemed to belong to an even older Narnia than the Narnia of
               which his nurse had told him.</p>
            <p>It was after they had taken up their quarters in and around the How that fortune
               began to turn against them. King Miraz's scouts soon found their new lair, and he and
               his army arrived on the edge of the woods. And as so often happens, the enemy turned
               out stronger than they had reckoned. Caspian's heart sank as he saw company after
               company arriving. And though Miraz's men may have been afraid of going into the wood,
               they were even more afraid of Miraz, and with him in command they carried battle
               deeply into it and sometimes almost to the How itself. Caspian and other captains of
               course made many sorties into the open country. Thus there was fighting on most days
               and sometimes by night as well; but Caspian's party had on the whole the worst of
               it.</p>
            <p>At last there came a night when everything had gone as badly as possible, and the
               rain which had been falling heavily all day had ceased at nightfall only to give
               place to raw cold. That morning Caspian had arranged what was his biggest battle yet,
               and all had hung their hopes on it. He, with most of the Dwarfs, was to have fallen
               on the King's right wing at daybreak, and then, when they were heavily engaged, Giant
               Wimbleweather, with the Centaurs and some of the fiercest beasts, was to have broken
               out from another place and endeavoured to cut the King's right off from the rest of
               the army. But it had all failed. No one had warned Caspian (because no one in these
               later days of Narnia remembered) that Giants are not at all clever. Poor
               Wimbleweather, though as brave as a lion, was a true Giant in that respect. He had
               broken out at the wrong time and from the wrong place, and both his party and
               Caspian's had suffered badly and done the enemy little harm. The best of the Bears
               had been hurt, a Centaur terribly wounded, and there were few in Caspian's party who
               had not lost blood. It was a gloomy company that huddled under the dripping trees to
               eat their scanty supper.</p>
            <p>The gloomiest of all was Giant Wimbleweather. He knew it was all his fault. He sat in
               silence shedding big tears which collected on the end of his nose and then fell off
               with a huge splash on the whole bivouac of the Mice, who had just been beginning to
               get warm and drowsy. They all jumped up, shaking the water out of their ears and
               wringing their little blankets, and asked the Giant in shrill but forcible voices
               whether he thought they weren't wet enough without this sort of thing. And then other
               people woke up and told the Mice they had been enrolled as scouts and not as a
               concert party, and asked why they couldn't keep quiet. And Wimbleweather tiptoed away
               to find some place where he could be miserable in peace and stepped on somebody's
               tail and somebody (they said afterwards it was a fox) bit him. And so everyone was
               out of temper.</p>
            <p>But in the secret and magical chamber at the heart of the How, King Caspian, with
               Cornelius and the Badger and Nikabrik and Trumpkin, were at council. Thick pillars of
               ancient workmanship supported the roof. In the centre was the Stone itself--a stone
               table, split right down the centre, and covered with what had once been writing of
               some kind: but ages of wind and rain and snow had almost worn them away in old times
               when the Stone Table had stood on the hilltop, and the Mound had not yet been built
               above it. They were not using the Table nor sitting round it: it was too magic a
               thing for any common use. They sat on logs a little way from it, and between them was
               a rough wooden table, on which stood a rude clay lamp lighting up their pale faces
               and throwing big shadows on the walls.</p>

                  and his mighty consorts down from the high past. But in either case, I do not
                  think we can be sure that the help will come to this very spot----"</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"You never said a truer

                  ancient and most deeply magical of all, and here, I think, the answer is likeliest
                  to come. But there are two others. One is Lantern Waste, up-river, west of
                  Beaversdam, where the Royal Children first appeared in Narnia, as the records
                  tell. The other is down at the river-mouth, where their castle of Cair Paravel
                  once stood. And if Aslan himself comes, that would be the best place for meeting
                  him too, for every story says that he is the son of the great Emperor-over-Sea,
                  and over the sea he will pass. I should like very much to send messengers to both

               (not to say conceit), he no sooner heard it than he was eager to be off. It was
               arranged that he should run for Lantern Waste while Trumpkin made the shorter journey
               to the river-mouth. After a hasty meal they both set off with the fervent thanks and
               good wishes of the King, the Badger, and Cornelius.</p>

               (for, as you have realised, it was he who had been telling all this story to the four
               children, sitting on the grass in the ruined hall of Cair Paravel)--<said

                  my pocket, left behind all weapons but my dagger, and took to the woods in the
                  grey of the morning. I'd been plugging away for many hours when there came a sound
                  that I'd never heard the like of in my born days. Eh, I won't forget that. The
                  whole air was full of it, loud as thunder but far longer, cool and sweet as music
                  over water, but strong enough to shake the woods. And I said to myself,</said>

                  wondered, but I went on as hard as I could pelt. I kept on all night--and then,
                  when it was half light this morning, as if I'd no more sense than a Giant, I
                  risked a short cut across open country to cut off a big loop of the river, and was
                  caught. Not by the army, but by a pompous old fool who has charge of a little
                  castle which is Miraz's last stronghold towards the coast. I needn't tell you they
                  got no true tale out of me, but I was a Dwarf and that was enough. But, lobsters

                  pompous fool. Anyone else would have run me through there and then. But nothing
                  would do for him short of a grand execution: sending me down 'to the ghosts' in
                  the full ceremonial way. And then this young lady"</said> (he nodded at Susan)
                  <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"does her bit of

                  feel so queer is that in the stories it's always someone in our world who does the

                  see that,"</said> said the Dwarf, whose pipe seemed to be blocked (at any rate he
               made himself very busy cleaning it). <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="sp pp lp ep">"But--well--I mean----"</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"But don't you yet see who we

                  it's very interesting, no doubt. But--no offence?"</said>--and he hesitated
               again.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"Do get on and say whatever you're
                  going to say,"</said> said Edmund.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"Well, then--no

                  toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"But, you know, the King and Trufflehunter and Doctor
                  Cornelius were expecting--well, if you see what I mean, help. To put it in another

                  fond of children and all that, but just at the moment, in the middle of a war--but
                  I'm sure you understand."</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"You mean you think we're no
                  good,"</said> said Edmund, getting red in the face.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"Now pray don't be
                  offended,"</said> interrupted the Dwarf. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"I assure you, my dear little friends----"</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"<emph rend="italic">Little</emph> from
                  you is really a bit too much,"</said> said Edmund, jumping up. <said who="ep"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"I suppose you don't believe we won the Battle of
                  Beruna? Well, you can say what you like about me because I know----"</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"There's no good losing our tempers,"
                  said Peter. "Let's fit him out with fresh armour and fit ourselves out from the
                  treasure chamber, and have a talk after that."</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"I don't quite see the
                  point----"</said> began Edmund, but Lucy whispered in his ear, <said who="lp"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"Hadn't we better do what Peter says? He is the High
                  King, you know. And I think he has an idea."</said> So Edmund agreed and by the
               aid of his torch they all, including Trumpkin, went down the steps again into the
               dark coldness and dusty splendour of the treasure house.</p>
            <p>The Dwarf's eyes glistened as he saw the wealth that lay on the shelves (though it
               had to stand on tiptoes to do so) and he muttered to himself, <said who="trumpkin"
                  aloud="false">"It would never do to let Nikabrik see this; never."</said> They
               found easily enough a mail shirt for him, a sword, a helmet, a shield, a bow and
               quiverful of arrows, all of dwarfish size. The helmet was of copper, set with rubies,
               and there was gold on the hilt of the sword: Trumpkin had never seen, much less
               carried, so much wealth in all his life. The children also put on mail shirts and
               helmets; a sword and shield were found for Edmund and a bow for Lucy--Peter and Susan
               were of course already carrying their gifts. As they came back up the stairway,
               jingling in their mail, and already looking and feeling more like Narnians and less
               like school-children, the two boys were behind, apparently making some plan. Lucy
               heard Edmund say, <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp">"No, let me do it. It
                  will be more of a sucks for him if I win, and less of a let-down for us all if I
                  fail."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"All right, Ed,"</said> said Peter.</p>
            <p>When they came out into the daylight Edmund turned to the Dwarf very politely and
               said, <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"I've got something to ask you.
                  Kids like us don't often have the chance of meeting a great warrior like you.
                  Would you have a little fencing match with me? It would be frightfully
                  decent."</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"But, lad,"</said> said Trumpkin, <said
                  who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"these swords are sharp."</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"I know,"</said> said Edmund. <said
                  who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"But I'll never get anywhere near you and
                  you'll be quite clever enough to disarm me without doing me any
               damage."</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"It's a dangerous game,"</said> said
               Trumpkin. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"But since you make such a
                  point of it, I'll try a pass or two."</said></p>
            <p>Both swords were out in a moment and the three others jumped off the dais and stood
               watching. It was well worth it. It was not like the silly fighting you see with broad
               swords on the stage. It was not even like the rapier fighting which you sometimes see
               rather better done. This was real broad-sword fighting. The great thing is to slash
               at your enemy's legs and feet because they are the part that have no armour. And when
               he slashes at yours you jump with both feet off the ground so that his blow goes
               under them. This gave the Dwarf an advantage because Edmund, being much taller, had
               to be always stooping. I don't think Edmund would have had a chance if he had fought
               Trumpkin twenty-four hours earlier. But the air of Narnia had been working upon him
               ever since they arrived on the island, and all his old battles came back to him, and
               his arms and fingers remembered their old skill. He was King Edmund once more. Round
               and round the two combatants circled, stroke after stroke they gave, and Susan (who
               never could learn to like this sort of thing) shouted out, "Oh, _do_ be careful." And
               then, so quickly that no one (unless they knew, as Peter did) could quite see how it
               happened, Edmund flashed his sword round with a peculiar twist, the Dwarf's sword
               flew out of his grip, and Trumpkin was wringing his empty hand as you do after a
               "sting" from a cricket-bat.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"Not hurt, I hope, my dear little
                  friend?"</said> said Edmund, panting a little and returning his own sword to its
               sheath.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"I see the point,"</said> said Trumpkin
               drily. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"You know a trick I never
                  learned."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"That's quite true,"</said> put in
               Peter. <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"The best swordsman in the world
                  may be disarmed by a trick that's new to him. I think it's only fair to give
                  Trumpkin a chance at something else. Will you have a shooting match with my
                  sister? There are no tricks in archery, you know."</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"Ah, you're jokers, you
                  are,"</said> said the Dwarf. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"I begin to see. As if I didn't know how she can shoot, after
                  what happened this morning. All the same, I'll have a try." He spoke gruffly, but
                  his eyes brightened, for he was a famous bowman among his own people.</said></p>
            <p>All five of them came out into the courtyard.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin sp ep lp">"What's to be the
                  target?"</said> asked Peter.</p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp trumpkin">"I think that apple hanging
                  over the wall on the branch there would do,"</said> said Susan.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"That'll do nicely, lass,"</said> said
               Trumpkin. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"You mean the yellow one near
                  the middle of the arch?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"No, not that,"</said> said Susan.
                  <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"The red one up above--over the
                  battlement."</said></p>
            <p>The Dwarf's face fell. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="false">"Looks more like a cherry
                  than an apple,"</said> he muttered, but he said nothing out loud.</p>
            <p>They tossed up for first shot (greatly to the interest of Trumpkin, who had never
               seen a coin tossed before) and Susan lost. They were to shoot from the top of the
               steps that led from the hall into the courtyard. Everyone could see from the way the
               Dwarf took his position and handled the bow that he knew what he was about.</p>
            <p>Twang went the string. It was an excellent shot. The tiny apple shook as the arrow
               passed, and a leaf came fluttering down. Then Susan went to the top of the steps and
               strung her bow. She was not enjoying her match half so much as Edmund had enjoyed
               his; not because she had any doubt about hitting the apple but because Susan was so
               tender-hearted that she almost hated to beat someone who had been beaten already. The
               Dwarf watched her keenly as she drew the shaft to her ear. A moment later, with a
               little soft thump which they could all hear in that quiet place, the apple fell to
               the grass with Susan's arrow in it.</p>
            <p><said who="pp ep lp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"Oh, well done, Su,"</said> shouted the
               other children.</p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"It wasn't really any better than
                  yours,"</said> said Susan to the Dwarf. <said who="sp" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="trumpkin">"I think there was a tiny breath of wind as you
               shot."</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"No there wasn't,"</said> said

            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"Oh, are you wounded?"</said> asked

            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"It's not a sight for little

                  again,"</said> he said. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"I suppose

               his hauberk and slipped down his little shirt, showing an arm hairy and muscular (in
               proportion) as a sailor's though not much bigger than a child's. There was a clumsy
               bandage on the shoulder which Lucy proceeded to unroll. Underneath, the cut looked
               very nasty and there was a good deal of swelling. <said who="lp" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="trumpkin">"Oh, poor Trumpkin,"</said> said Lucy. <said who="lp"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"How horrid."</said> Then she carefully dripped on
               to it one single drop of the cordial from her flask.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Hullo. Eh? What have you done?</said>"
               said Trumpkin. But however he turned his head and squinted and whisked his beard to
               and fro, he couldn't quite see his own shoulder. Then he felt it as well as he could,
               getting his arms and fingers into very difficult positions as you do when you're
               trying to scratch a place that is just out of reach. Then he swung his arm and raised
               it and tried the muscles, and finally jumped to his feet crying, <said who="trumpkin"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Giants and junipers! It's cured! It's as good as
                  new."</said> After that he burst into a great laugh and said, <said who="trumpkin"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"Well, I've made as big a fool of myself as ever
                  a Dwarf did. No offence, I hope? My humble duty to your Majesties all--humble
                  duty. And thanks for my life, my cure, my breakfast--and my lesson."</said></p>
            <p>The children all said it was quite all right and not to mention it.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"And now,"</said> said Peter, <said
                  who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"if you've really decided to believe in

            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"I have,"</said> said the
               Dwarf.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin sp ep lp">"It's quite clear what we have

            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"The sooner the

            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"It's about two days' journey, the way

                  us, I mean. We can't walk all day and night like you Dwarfs." Then he turned to
                  the others. "What Trumpkin calls Aslan's How is obviously the Stone Table itself.
                  You remember it was about half a day's march, or a little less, from there down to

            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Beruna's Bridge, we call it,"</said>

                  from Beruna down to here was another day and a bit. We used to get home about
                  teatime on the second day, going easily. Going hard, we could do the whole thing
                  in a day and a half perhaps."</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"But remember it's all woods

            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"Oh, Edmund,"</said> said Susan. <said

            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"That's all right, lass--I mean your

                  toWhom="sp">"A jibe won't raise a blister."</said> (And after that they often
               called him the D.L.F. till they'd almost forgotten what it meant.)</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp trumpkin">"As I was saying,"</said>
               continued Edmund, <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp trumpkin">"we needn't
                  go that way. Why shouldn't we row a little south till we come to Glasswater Creek

                  safe while we're at sea. If we start at once, we can be at the head of Glasswater
                  before dark, get a few hours' sleep, and be with Caspian pretty early
                  to-morrow."</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp ep">"What a thing it is to know
                  the coast,"</said> said Trumpkin. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp sp lp ep">"None of us know anything about Glasswater."</said></p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp trumpkin">"What about food?"</said>
               asked Susan.</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"Oh, we'll have to do with apples,"</said>
               said Lucy. <said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep trumpkin">"Do let's get on.
                  We've done nothing yet, and we've been here nearly two days."</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp trumpkin">"And anyway, no one's going to
                  have my hat for a fish-basket again,"</said> said Edmund.</p>
            <p>They used one of the raincoats as a kind of bag and put a good many apples in it.
               Then they all had a good long drink at the well (for they would meet no more fresh
               water till they landed at the head of the Creek) and went down to the boat. The
               children were sorry to leave Cair Paravel, which, even in ruins, had begun to feel
               like home again.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp trumpkin">"The D.L.F. had better
                  steer,"</said> said Peter, <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp trumpkin"
                  >"and Ed and I will take an oar each. Half a moment, though. We'd better take off
                  our mail: we're going to be pretty warm before we're done. The girls had better be
                  in the bows and shout directions to the D.L.F. because he doesn't know the way.
                  You'd better get us a fair way out to sea till we've passed the
               island."</said></p>
            <p>And soon the green, wooded coast of the island was falling away behind them, and its
               little bays and headlands were beginning to look flatter, and the boat was rising and
               falling in the gentle swell. The sea began to grow bigger around them and, in the
               distance, bluer, but close round the boat it was green and bubbly. Everything smelled
               salt and there was no noise except the swishing of water and the clop-clop of water
               against the sides and the splash of the oars and the jolting noise of the rowlocks.
               The sun grew hot.</p>
            <p>It was delightful for Lucy and Susan in the bows, bending over the edge and trying to
               get their hands in the sea which they could never quite reach. The bottom, mostly
               pure, pale sand but with occasional patches of purple seaweed, could be seen beneath
               them.</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"It's like old times,"</said> said
               Lucy. <said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"Do you remember our voyage to
                  Terebinthia--and Galma--and Seven Isles--and the Lone Islands?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp">"Yes," said Susan, "and our great ship
                  the <emph rend="italic">Splendour Hyaline</emph>, with the swan's head at her prow
                  and the carved swan's wings coming back almost to her waist?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"And the silken sails, and the great
                  stern lanterns?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"And the feasts on the poop and the

            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"Do you remember when we had the
                  musicians up in the rigging playing flutes so that it sounded like music out of
                  the sky?"</said></p>
            <p>Presently Susan took over Edmund's oar and he came forward to join Lucy. They had
               passed the island now and stood closer in to the shore--all wooded and deserted. They
               would have thought it very pretty if they had not remembered the time when it was
               open and breezy and full of merry friends.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp trumpkin">"Phew! This is pretty
                  gruelling work," said Peter.</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Can't I row for a bit?"</said> said
               Lucy.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"The oars are too big for you,"</said> said
               Peter shortly, not because he was cross but because he had no strength to spare for
               talking.</p>

         <div type="chapter" n="9">
            <head>What Lucy Saw</head>
            <p>Susan and the two boys were bitterly tired with rowing before they rounded the last
               headland and began the final pull up Glasswater itself, and Lucy's head ached from
               the long hours of sun and the glare on the water. Even Trumpkin longed for the voyage
               to be over. The seat on which he sat to steer had been made for men, not Dwarfs, and
               his feet did not reach the floor-boards; and everyone knows how uncomfortable that is
               even for ten minutes. And as they all grew more tired, their spirits fell. Up till
               now the children had only been thinking of how to get to Caspian. Now they wondered
               what they would do when they found him, and how a handful of Dwarfs and woodland
               creatures could defeat an army of grown-up Humans.</p>
            <p>Twilight was coming on as they rowed slowly up the windings of Glasswater Creek--a
               twilight which deepened as the banks drew closer together and the overhanging trees
               began almost to meet overhead. It was very quiet in here as the sound of the sea died
               away behind them; they could even hear the trickle of the little streams that poured
               down from the forest into Glasswater.</p>
            <p>They went ashore at last, far too tired to attempt lighting a fire; and even a supper
               of apples (though most of them felt that they never wanted to see an apple again)
               seemed better than trying to catch or shoot anything. After a little silent munching
               they all huddled down together in the moss and dead leaves between four large beech
               trees.</p>
            <p>Everyone except Lucy went to sleep at once. Lucy, being far less tired, found it hard
               to get comfortable. Also, she had forgotten till now that all Dwarfs snore. She knew
               that one of the best ways of getting to sleep is to stop trying, so she opened her
               eyes. Through a gap in the bracken and branches she could just see a patch of water
               in the Creek and the sky above it. Then, with a thrill of memory, she saw again,
               after all those years, the bright Narnian stars. She had once known them better than
               the stars of our own world, because as a Queen in Narnia she had gone to bed much
               later than as a child in England. And there they were--at least, three of the summer
               constellations could be seen from where she lay: the Ship, the Hammer, and the
               Leopard. <said who="lp" aloud="true">"Dear old Leopard,"</said> she murmured happily
               to herself.</p>
            <p>Instead of getting drowsier she was getting more awake--with an odd, night-time,
               dreamish kind of wakefulness. The Creek was growing brighter. She knew now that the
               moon was on it, though she couldn't see the moon. And now she began to feel that the
               whole forest was coming awake like herself. Hardly knowing why she did it, she got up
               quickly and walked a little distance away from their bivouac.</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="false">"This is lovely,"</said> said Lucy to herself. It was
               cool and fresh; delicious smells were floating everywhere. Somewhere close by she
               heard the twitter of a nightingale beginning to sing, then stopping, then beginning
               again. It was a little lighter ahead. She went towards the light and came to a place
               where there were fewer trees, and whole patches or pools of moonlight, but the
               moonlight and the shadows so mixed that you could hardly be sure where anything was
               or what it was. At the same moment the nightingale, satisfied at last with his tuning
               up, burst into full song.</p>
            <p>Lucy's eyes began to grow accustomed to the light, and she saw the trees that were
               nearest her more distinctly. A great longing for the old days when the trees could
               talk in Narnia came over her. She knew exactly how each of these trees would talk if
               only she could wake them, and what sort of human form it would put on. She looked at
               a silver birch: it would have a soft, showery voice and would look like a slender
               girl, with hair blown all about her face, and fond of dancing. She looked at the oak:
               he would be a wizened, but hearty old man with a frizzled beard and warts on his face
               and hands, and hair growing out of the warts. She looked at the beech under which she
               was standing. Ah!--she would be the best of all. She would be a gracious goddess,
               smooth and stately, the lady of the wood.</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"Oh, Trees, Trees, Trees,"</said> said
               Lucy (though she had not been intending to speak at all). <said who="lp" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp sp ep">"Oh, Trees, wake, wake, wake. Don't you remember it? Don't you
                  remember <emph rend="italic">me</emph>? Dryads and Hamadryads, come out, come to
                  me."</said></p>
            <p>Though there was not a breath of wind they all stirred about her. The rustling noise
               of the leaves was almost like words. The nightingale stopped singing as if to listen
               to it. Lucy felt that at any moment she would begin to understand what the trees were
               trying to say. But the moment did not come. The rustling died away. The nightingale
               resumed its song. Even in the moonlight the wood looked more ordinary again. Yet Lucy
               had the feeling (as you sometimes have when you are trying to remember a name or a
               date and almost get it, but it vanishes before you really do) that she had just
               missed something: as if she had spoken to the trees a split second too soon or a
               split second too late, or used all the right words except one, or put in one word
               that was just wrong.</p>
            <p>Quite suddenly she began to feel tired. She went back to the bivouac, snuggled down
               between Susan and Peter, and was asleep in a few minutes.</p>
            <p>It was a cold and cheerless waking for them all next morning, with a grey twilight in
               the wood (for the sun had not yet risen) and everything damp and dirty.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"Apples, heigh-ho,"</said>
               said Trumpkin with a rueful grin. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"I must say you ancient kings and queens don't overfeed your
                  courtiers!"</said></p>
            <p>They stood up and shook themselves and looked about. The trees were thick and they
               could see no more than a few yards in any direction.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"I suppose your Majesties know
                  the way all right?</said>" said the Dwarf.</p>

                  who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"I've never seen these woods in my life
                  before. In fact I thought all along that we ought to have gone by the

            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"Then I think you might have said so at the

                  her,"</said> said Edmund. <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"She

            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp"> "I know," </said>said Peter. <said
                  who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp"> "The one that joins the big river at the

               <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"That's right. Cross it and strike

            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep"> "I hope you're right,"</said> said Susan.
                  <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"I can't remember all that at
               all."</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp trumpkin">"That's the worst of girls,"</said>
               said Edmund to Peter and the Dwarf. <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp trumpkin"
                  >"They never can carry a map in their heads."</said></p>
            <p>
               <said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep trumpkin">"That's because our heads have
                  something inside them,"</said> said Lucy.</p>
            <p> At first things seemed to be going pretty well. They even thought they had struck an
               old path; but if you know anything about woods, you will know that one is always
               finding imaginary paths. They disappear after about five minutes and then you think
               you have found another (and hope it is not another but more of the same one) and it
               also disappears, and after you have been well lured out of your right direction you
               realise that none of them were paths at all. The boys and the Dwarf, however, were
               used to woods and were not taken in for more than a few seconds.</p>
            <p>They had plodded on for about half an hour (three of. them very stiff from
               yesterday's rowing) when Trumpkin suddenly whispered, "Stop." They all stopped.
               "There's something following us," he said in a low voice. "Or rather, something
               keeping up with us: over there on the left." They all stood still, listening and
               staring till their ears and eyes ached. "You and I'd better each have an arrow on the
               string," said Susan to Trumpkin. The Dwarf nodded, and when both bows were ready for
               action the party went on again.</p>
            <p>They went a few dozen yards through fairly open woodland, keeping a sharp look-out.
               Then they came to a place where the undergrowth thickened and they had to pass nearer
               to it. Just as they were passing the place, there came a sudden something that
               snarled and flashed, rising out from the breaking twigs like a thunderbolt. Lucy was
               knocked down and winded, hearing the twang of a bowstring as she fell. When she was
               able to take notice of things again, she saw a great grim-looking grey bear lying
               dead with Trumpkin's arrow in its side.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"The D.L.F. beat you in <emph rend="italic"
                     >that</emph> shooting match, Su,"</said> said Peter, with a slightly forced
               smile. Even he had been shaken by this adventure.</p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"I--I left it too late,"</said> said Susan,
               in an embarrassed voice. <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"I was so afraid it
                  might be, you know--one of our kind of bears, a <emph rend="italic">talking</emph>
                  bear."</said> She hated killing things.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"That's the trouble of it,"</said> said
               Trumpkin, <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"when most of the beasts have
                  gone enemy and gone dumb, but there are still some of the other kind left. You
                  never know, and you daren't wait to see."</said></p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"Poor old Bruin,"</said> said Susan.
                  <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"You don't think he was?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"Not he,"</said> said the Dwarf. <said
                  who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"I saw the face and I heard the snarl. He
                  only wanted Little Girl for his breakfast.</said>
               <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">And talking of breakfast, I
                  didn't want to discourage your Majesties when you said you hoped King Caspian
                  would give you a good one: but meat's precious scarce in camp. And there's good
                  eating on a bear. It would be a shame to leave the carcass without taking a bit,
                  and it won't delay us more than half an hour. I dare say you two
                  youngsters--Kings, I should say--know how to skin a bear?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Let's go and sit down a fair way
                  off,"</said> said Susan to Lucy. <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"I know
                  what a horrid messy business <emph rend="italic">that</emph> will be."</said> Lucy
               shuddered and nodded. When they had sat down she said: <said who="lp" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="sp">"Such a horrible idea has come into my head, Su."</said></p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"What's that?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"Wouldn't it be dreadful if some day, in our
                  own world, at home, men started going wild inside, like the animals here, and
                  still looked like men, so that you'd never know which were which?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"We've got enough to bother about here and
                  now in Narnia,"</said> said the practical Susan, <said who="sp" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="lp">"without imagining things like that."</said></p>
            <p>When they rejoined the boys and the Dwarf, as much as they thought they could carry
               of the best meat had been cut off. Raw meat is not a nice thing to fill one's pockets
               with, but they folded it up in fresh leaves and made the best of it. They were all
               experienced enough to know that they would feel quite differently about these squashy
               and unpleasant parcels when they had walked long enough to be really hungry.</p>
            <p>On they trudged again (stopping to wash three pairs of hands that needed it in the
               first stream they passed) until the sun rose and the birds began to sing, and more
               flies than they wanted were buzzing in the bracken. The stiffness from yesterday's
               rowing began to wear off.</p>
            <p>Everybody's spirits rose. The sun grew warmer and they took their helmets off and
               carried them.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp trumpkin">"I suppose we are going
                  right?"</said> said Edmund about an hour later.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp trumpkin">"I don't see how we can go
                  wrong as long as we don't bear too much to the left,"</said> said Peter. <said
                  who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp trumpkin">"If we bear too much to the
                  right, the worst that can happen is wasting a little time by striking the Great
                  River too soon and not cutting off the corner."</said></p>
            <p>And again they trudged on with no sound except the thud of their feet and the jingle
               of their chain shirts.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp trumpking">"Where's this bally Rush got
                  to?"</said> said Edmund a good deal later.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp trumpkin">"I certainly thought we'd have
                  struck it by now,"</said> said Peter. <said who="pp" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="sp ep lp trumpkin">"But there's nothing to do but keep on."</said> They
               both knew that the Dwarf was looking anxiously at them, but he said nothing.</p>
            <p>And still they trudged on and their mail shirts began to feel very hot and heavy.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp trumpkin">"What on earth?"</said> said
               Peter suddenly.</p>
            <p>They had come, without seeing it, almost to the edge of a small precipice from which
               they looked down into a gorge with a river at the bottom. On the far side the cliffs
               rose much higher. None of the party except Edmund (and perhaps Trumpkin) was a rock
               climber.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp trumpkin">"I'm sorry,"</said> said
               Peter. <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp trumpkin">"It's my fault for
                  coming this way. We're lost. I've never seen this place in my life
               before."</said></p>
            <p>The Dwarf gave a low whistle between his teeth.</p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp trumpkin">"Oh, do let's go back and go
                  the other way,"</said> said Susan. <said who="sp" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp ep lp trumpkin">"I knew all along we'd get lost in these
               woods."</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"Susan!"</said> said Lucy, reproachfully,
                  <said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"don't nag at Peter like that. It's so
                  rotten, and he's doing all he can."</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"And don't you snap at Su like that,
                  either,"</said> said Edmund. <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"I think
                  she's quite right."</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"Tubs and
                  tortoiseshells!"</said> exclaimed Trumpkin. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"If we've got lost coming, what chance have we of finding our

                  supposing we could--we might as well give the whole thing up. Miraz will have
                  finished with Caspian before we get there at that rate."</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"You think we ought to go on?"</said>
               said Lucy.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"I'm not sure the High King <emph

            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp trumpkin">"Because the Rush is not in a
                  gorge,"</said> said Peter, keeping his temper with some difficulty.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Your Majesty says <emph rend="italic"
                     >is</emph>,"</said> replied the Dwarf, <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp">"but oughtn't you to say <emph rend="italic">was</emph>? You knew this
                  country hundreds--it may be a thousand--years ago. Mayn't it have changed? A
                  landslide might have pulled off half the side of that hill, leaving bare rock, and
                  there are your precipices beyond the gorge. Then the Rush might go on deepening
                  its course year after year till you get the little precipices this side. Or there
                  might have been an earthquake, or anything."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"I never thought of that,"</said> said
               Peter.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"And anyway,"</said> continued
               Trumpkin, <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"even if this is not
                  the Rush, it's flowing roughly north and so it must fall into the Great River
                  anyway. I think I passed something that might have been it, on my way down. So if
                  we go down-stream, to our right, we'll hit the Great River. Perhaps not so high as
                  we'd hoped, but at least we'll be no worse off than if you'd come my
               way."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"Trumpkin, you're a brick,"</said> said
               Peter. <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp trumpkin">"Come on, then. Down

            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep trumpkin">"Look! Look! Look!"</said>
               cried Lucy.</p>
            <p><said who="pp sp ep trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Where? What?"</said> asked

            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"How do you know that was what he

            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"Oh, don't be so stupid,"</said> said

            <p>Lucy turned crimson and I think she would have flown at Trumpkin, if Peter had not

               hand.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"And now it's your turn, Peter,"</said> said
               Susan, <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"and I do hope----"</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"Oh, shut up, shut up and let a chap
                  think,"</said> interrupted Peter. <said who="pp" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="sp ep lp trumpkin">"I'd much rather not have to vote."</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"You're the High King,"</said> said
               Trumpkin sternly.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp trumpkin">"Down,"</said> said Peter
               after a long pause. <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp trumpkin">"I know
                  Lucy may be right after all, but I can't help it. We must do one or the
                  other."</said></p>
            <p>So they set off to their right along the edge, downstream. And Lucy came last of the
               party, crying bitterly.</p>

         <div type="chapter" n="10">
            <head>The Return of the Lion</head>
            <p>To keep along the edge of the gorge was not so easy as it had looked. Before they had
               gone many yards they were confronted with young fir woods growing on the very edge,
               and after they had tried to go through these, stooping and pushing for about ten
               minutes, they realised that, in there, it would take them an hour to do half a mile.
               So they came back and out again and decided to go round the fir wood. This took them
               much farther to their right than they wanted to go, far out of sight of the cliffs
               and out of sound of the river, till they began to be afraid they had lost it
               altogether. Nobody knew the time, but it was getting to the hottest part of the
               day.</p>
            <p>When they were able at last to go back to the edge of the gorge (nearly a mile below
               the point from which they had started) they found the cliffs on their side of it a
               good deal lower and more broken. Soon they found a way down into the gorge and
               continued the journey at the river's edge. But first they had a rest and a long
               drink. No one was talking any more about breakfast, or even dinner, with Caspian.</p>
            <p>They may have been wise to stick to the Rush instead of going along the top. It kept
               them sure of their direction: and ever since the fir wood they had all been afraid of
               being forced too far out of their course and losing themselves in the wood. It was an
               old and pathless forest, and you could not keep anything like a straight course in
               it. Patches of hopeless brambles, fallen trees, boggy places and dense undergrowth
               would be always getting in your way. But the gorge of the Rush was not at all a nice
               place for travelling either. I mean, it was not a nice place for people in a hurry.
               For an afternoon's ramble ending in a picnic tea it would have been delightful. It
               had everything you could want on an occasion of that sort--rumbling waterfalls,
               silver cascades, deep, amber-coloured pools, mossy rocks, and deep moss on the banks
               in which you could sink over your ankles, every kind of fern, jewel-like dragon
               flies, sometimes a hawk overhead and once (Peter and Trumpkin both thought) an eagle.
               But of course what the children and the Dwarf wanted to see as soon as possible was
               the Great River below them, and Beruna, and the way to Aslan's How.</p>
            <p>As they went on, the Rush began to fall more and more steeply. Their journey became
               more and more of a climb and less and less of a walk--in places even a dangerous
               climb over slippery rock with a nasty drop into dark chasms, and the river roaring
               angrily at the bottom.</p>
            <p>You may be sure they watched the cliffs on their left eagerly for any sign of a break
               or any place where they could climb them; but those cliffs remained cruel. It was
               maddening, because everyone knew that if once they were out of the gorge on that
               side, they would have only a smooth slope and a fairly short walk to Caspian's
               headquarters.</p>
            <p>The boys and the Dwarf were now in favour of lighting a fire and cooking their
               bear-meat. Susan didn't want this; she only wanted, as she said, <said who="sp"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp trumpkin">"to get on and finish it and get out of
                  these beastly woods".</said> Lucy was far too tired and miserable to have any
               opinion about anything. But as there was no dry wood to be had, it mattered very
               little what anyone thought. The boys began to wonder if raw meat was really as nasty
               as they had always been told. Trumpkin assured them it was.</p>
            <p>Of course, if the children had attempted a journey like this a few days ago in
               England, they would have been knocked up. I think I have explained before how Narnia
               was altering them. Even Lucy was by now, so to speak, only one-third of a little girl
               going to boarding school for the first time, and two-thirds of Queen Lucy of
               Narnia.</p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp trumpkin">"At last!"</said> said
               Susan.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp trumpkin">"Oh, hurray!"</said> said
               Peter.</p>
            <p>The river gorge had just made a bend and the whole view spread out beneath them. They
               could see open country stretching before them to the horizon and, between it and
               them, the broad silver ribbon of the Great River. They could see the specially broad
               and shallow place which had once been the Fords of Beruna but was now spanned by a
               long, many-arched bridge. There was a little town at the far end of it.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp trumpkin">"By Jove,"</said> said Edmund.
                  <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp trumpkin">"We fought the Battle of
                  Beruna just where that town is!"</said></p>
            <p>This cheered the boys more than anything. You can't help feeling stronger when you
               look at a place where you won a glorious victory, not to mention a kingdom, hundreds
               of years ago. Peter and Edmund were soon so busy talking about the battle that they
               forgot their sore feet and the heavy drag of their mail shirts on their shoulders.
               The Dwarf was interested too.</p>
            <p>They were all getting on at a quicker pace now. The going became easier. Though there
               were still sheer cliffs on their left, the ground was becoming lower on their right.
               Soon it was no longer a gorge at all, only a valley. There were no more waterfalls
               and presently they were in fairly thick woods again.</p>
            <p>Then--all at once--<emph rend="italic">whizz</emph>, and a sound rather like the
               stroke of a woodpecker. The children were still wondering where (ages ago) they had
               heard a sound just like that and why they disliked it so, when Trumpkin shouted,
                  <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"Down,"</said> at the same
               moment forcing Lucy (who happened to be next to him) flat down into the bracken.
               Peter, who had been looking up to see if he could spot a squirrel, had seen what it
               was--a long cruel arrow had sunk into a tree trunk just above his head. As he pulled
               Susan down and dropped himself, another came rasping over his shoulder and struck the
               ground at his side.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"Quick! Quick! Get back! <emph
                     rend="italic">Crawl</emph>!"</said> panted Trumpkin.</p>
            <p>They turned and wriggled along uphill, under the bracken, amid clouds of horribly
               buzzing flies. Arrows whizzed round them. One struck Susan's helmet with a sharp ping
               and glanced off. They crawled quicker. Sweat poured off them. Then they ran, stooping
               nearly double. The boys held their swords in their hands for fear they would trip
               them up.</p>
            <p>It was heart-breaking work--all uphill again, back over the ground they had already
               travelled. When they felt that they really couldn't run any more, even to save their
               lives, they all dropped down in the damp moss beside a waterfall and behind a big
               boulder, panting. They were surprised to see how high they had already got.</p>
            <p>They listened intently and heard no sound of pursuit.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"So <emph rend="italic"
                     >that's</emph> all right,"</said> said Trumpkin, drawing a deep breath. <said
                  who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"They're not searching the wood.
                  Only sentries, I expect. But it means that Miraz has an outpost down there.
                  Bottles and battledores! though, it was a near thing."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp trumpkin">"I ought to have my head
                  smacked for bringing us this way at all,"</said> said Peter.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"On the contrary, your Majesty,"</said>
               said the Dwarf. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"For one thing it
                  wasn't you, it was your royal brother, King Edmund, who first suggested going by
                  Glasswater."</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp trumpkin">"I'm afraid the D.L.F.'s
                  right,"</said> said Edmund, who had quite honestly forgotten this ever since
               things began going wrong.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"And for another,"</said>
               continued Trumpkin, <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"if we'd
                  gone my way, we'd have walked straight into that new outpost, most likely; or at
                  least had just the same trouble avoiding it. I think this Glasswater route has
                  turned out for the best."</said></p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp trumpkin">"A blessing in
                  disguise,"</said> said Susan.</p>
            <p>"<said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp trumpkin">Some disguise!"</said> said
               Edmund.</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep trumpkin">"I suppose we'll have to go
                  right up the gorge again now,"</said> said Lucy.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Lu, you're a hero,"</said> said Peter. <said
                  who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"That's the nearest you've got to-day to saying
                     <emph rend="italic">I told you so</emph>. Let's get on."</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"And as soon as we're well up
                  into the forest,"</said> said Trumpkin, <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"whatever anyone says, I'm going to light a fire and cook
                  supper. But we must get well away from here."</said></p>
            <p>There is no need to describe how they toiled back up the gorge. It was pretty hard
               work, but oddly enough everyone felt more cheerful. They were getting their second
               wind; and the word supper had had a wonderful effect.</p>
            <p>They reached the fir wood which had caused them so much trouble while it was still
               daylight, and bivouacked in a hollow just above it. It was tedious gathering the fire
               wood; but it was grand when the fire blazed up and they began producing the damp and
               smeary parcels of bear-meat which would have been so very unattractive to anyone who
               had spent the day indoors. The Dwarf had splendid ideas about cookery. Each apple
               (they still had a few of these) was wrapped up in bear's meat--as if it was to be
               apple dumpling with meat instead of pastry, only much thicker--and spiked on a sharp
               stick and then roasted. And the juice of the apple worked all through the meat, like
               apple sauce with roast pork. Bear that has lived too much on other animals is not
               very nice, but bear that has had plenty of honey and fruit is excellent, and this
               turned out to be that sort of bear. It was a truly glorious meal. And, of course, no
               washing up--only lying back and watching the smoke from Trumpkin's pipe and
               stretching one's tired legs and chatting. Everyone felt quite hopeful now about
               finding King Caspian to-morrow and defeating Miraz in a few days. It may not have
               been sensible of them to feel like this, but they did.</p>
            <p>They dropped off to sleep one by one, but all pretty quickly.</p>
            <p>Lucy woke out of the deepest sleep you can imagine, with the feeling that the voice
               she liked best in the world had been calling her name. She thought at first it was
               her father's voice, but that did not seem quite right. Then she thought it was
               Peter's voice, but that did not seem to fit either. She did not want to get up; not
               because she was still tired--on the contrary she was wonderfully rested and all the
               aches had gone from her bones--but because she felt so extremely happy and
               comfortable. She was looking straight up at the Narnian moon, which is larger than
               ours, and at the starry sky, for the place where they had bivouacked was
               comparatively open.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Lucy,"</said> came the call again,
               neither her father's voice nor Peter's. She sat up, trembling with excitement but not
               with fear. The moon was so bright that the whole forest landscape around her was
               almost as clear as day, though it looked wilder. Behind her was the fir wood; away to
               her right the jagged cliff-tops on the far side of the gorge; straight ahead, open
               grass to where a glade of trees began about a bow-shot away. Lucy looked very hard at
               the trees of that glade.</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="false">"Why, I do believe they're moving,"</said> she said to
               her self. <said who="lp" aloud="false">"They're walking about."</said></p>
            <p>She got up, her heart beating wildly, and walked towards them. There was certainly a
               noise in the glade, a noise such as trees make in a high wind, though there was no
               wind to-night. Yet it was not exactly an ordinary tree-noise either. Lucy felt there
               was a tune in it, but she could not catch the tune any more than she had been able to
               catch the words when the trees had so nearly talked to her the night before. But
               there was, at least, a lilt; she felt her own feet wanting to dance as she got
               nearer. And now there was no doubt that the trees were really moving--moving in and
               out through one another as if in a complicated country dance. (<said who="lp"
                  aloud="false">"And I suppose,"</said> thought Lucy, <said who="lp" aloud="false"
                  >"when trees dance, it must be a very, very country dance indeed."</said>) She was
               almost among them now.</p>
            <p>The first tree she looked at seemed at first glance to be not a tree at all but a
               huge man with a shaggy beard and great bushes of hair. She was not frightened: she
               had seen such things before. But when she looked again he was only a tree, though he
               was still moving. You couldn't see whether he had feet or roots, of course, because
               when trees move they don't walk on the surface of the earth; they wade in it as we do
               in water. The same thing happened with every tree she looked at. At one moment they
               seemed to be the friendly, lovely giant and giantess forms which the tree-people put
               on when some good magic has called them into full life: next moment they all looked
               like trees again. But when they looked like trees, it was like strangely human trees,
               and when they looked like people, it was like strangely branchy and leafy people--and
               all the time that queer lilting, rustling, cool, merry noise.</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true">"They are almost awake, not quite,"</said> said Lucy. She
               knew she herself was wide awake, wider than anyone usually is.</p>
            <p>She went fearlessly in among them, dancing herself at, she leaped this way and that
               to avoid being run into by these huge partners. But she was only half interested in
               them. She wanted to get beyond them to something else; it was from beyond them that
               the dear voice had called.</p>
            <p>She soon got through them (half wondering whether she had been using her arms to push
               branches aside, or to take hands in a Great Chain with big dancers who stooped to
               reach her) for they were really a ring of trees round a central open place. She
               stepped out from among their shifting confusion of lovely lights and shadows.</p>
            <p>A circle of grass, smooth as a lawn, met her eyes, with dark trees dancing all round
               it. And then--oh joy! For he was there: the huge Lion, shining white in the
               moonlight, with his huge black shadow underneath him.</p>
            <p>But for the movement of his tail he might have been a stone lion, but Lucy never
               thought of that. She never stopped to think whether he was a friendly lion or not.
               She rushed to him. She felt her heart would burst if she lost a moment. And the next
               thing she knew was that she was kissing him and putting her arms as far round his
               neck as she could and burying her face in the beautiful rich silkiness of his
               mane.</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Aslan, Aslan. Dear Aslan,"</said> sobbed
               Lucy. <said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"At last."</said></p>
            <p>The great beast rolled over on his side so that Lucy fell, half sitting and half
               lying between his front paws. He bent forward and just touched her nose with his
               tongue. His warm breath came all round her. She gazed up into the large wise
               face.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Welcome, child,"</said> he said.</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Aslan," said Lucy,</said>
               <said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"you're bigger."</said></p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"That is because you are older, little
                  one,"</said> answered he.</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Not because you are?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"I am not. But every year you grow, you
                  will find me bigger."</said></p>
            <p>For a time she was so happy that she did not want to speak. But Aslan spoke.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Lucy,"</said> he said, <said who="aslan"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"we must not lie here for long. You have work in hand,
                  and much time has been lost to-day."</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Yes, wasn't it a shame?"</said> said
               Lucy. <said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"<emph rend="italic">I</emph> saw
                  you all right. They wouldn't believe me. They're all so----"</said></p>
            <p>From somewhere deep inside Aslan's body there came the faintest suggestion of a
               growl.</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"I'm sorry,"</said> said Lucy, who
               understood some of his moods. <said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"I didn't
                  mean to start slanging the others. But it wasn't my fault anyway, was
               it?"</said></p>
            <p>The Lion looked straight into her eyes.</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Oh, Aslan,"</said> said Lucy. <said
                  who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"You don't mean it was? How could I--I
                  couldn't have left the others and come up to you alone, how could I? Don't look at
                  me like that ... oh well, I suppose I <emph rend="italic">could</emph>. Yes, and
                  it wouldn't have been alone, I know, not if I was with you. But what would have
                  been the good?"</said></p>
            <p>Aslan said nothing.</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"You mean,"</said> said Lucy rather
               faintly, <said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"that it would have turned out
                  all right--somehow? But how? Please, Aslan! Am I not to know?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"To know what <emph rend="italic"
                     >would</emph> have happened, child?"</said> said Aslan. <said who="aslan"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"No. Nobody is ever told that."</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Oh dear,"</said> said Lucy.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"But anyone can find out what <emph
                     rend="italic">will</emph> happen,"</said> said Aslan. <said who="aslan"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"If you go back to the others now, and wake them up; and
                  tell them you have seen me again; and that you must all get up at once and follow
                  me--what will happen? There is only one way of finding out."</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Do you mean that is what you want me to
                  do?"</said> gasped Lucy.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Yes, little one,"</said> said Aslan.</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Will the others see you too?"</said>
               asked Lucy.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Certainly not at first," said Aslan.
                  "Later on, it depends."</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"But they won't believe me!"</said> said
               Lucy.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"It doesn't matter,"</said> said
               Aslan.</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Oh dear, oh dear,"</said> said Lucy.
                  <said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"And I was so pleased at finding you
                  again. And I thought you'd let me stay. And I thought you'd come roaring in and
                  frighten all the enemies away--like last time. And now everything is going to be
                  horrid."</said></p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"It is hard for you, little one,"</said>
               said Aslan. <said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"But things never happen the
                  same way twice. It has been hard for us all in Narnia before now."</said></p>
            <p>Lucy buried her head in his mane to hide from his face. But there must have been
               magic in his mane. She could feel lion-strength going into her. Quite suddenly she
               sat up.</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"I'm sorry, Aslan,"</said> she said. <said
                  who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"I'm ready now."></said></p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Now you are a lioness,"</said> said
               Aslan. <said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"And now all Narnia will be
                  renewed. But come. We have no time to lose."</said></p>
            <p>He got up and walked with stately, noiseless paces back to the belt of dancing trees
               through which she had just come: and Lucy went with him, laying a rather tremulous
               hand on his mane. The trees parted to let them through and for one second assumed
               their human forms completely. Lucy had a glimpse of tall and lovely wood-gods and
               wood-goddesses all bowing to the Lion; next moment they were trees again, but still
               bowing, with such graceful sweeps of branch and trunk that their bowing was itself a
               kind of dance.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Now, child,"</said> said Aslan, when they
               had left the trees behind them, <said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"I will
                  wait here. Go and wake the others and tell them to follow. If they will not, then
                  you at least must follow me alone."</said></p>
            <p>It is a terrible thing to have to wake four people, all older than yourself and all
               very tired, for the purpose of telling them something they probably won't believe and
               making them do something they certainly won't like. <said who="lp" aloud="false">"I
                  mustn't think about it, I must just do it,"</said> thought Lucy.</p>
            <p>She went to Peter first and shook him. <said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp"
                  >"Peter,"</said> she whispered in his ear, <said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp"
                  >"wake up. Quick. Aslan is here. He says we've got to follow him at
               once."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Certainly, Lu. Whatever you like,"</said>
               said Peter unexpectedly. This was encouraging, but as Peter instantly rolled round
               and went to sleep again it wasn't much use.</p>
            <p>Then she tried Susan. Susan did really wake up, but only to say in her most annoying
               grown-up voice, "You've been dreaming, Lucy. Go to sleep again."</p>
            <p>She tackled Edmund next. It was very difficult to wake him, but when at last she had
               done it he was really awake and sat up.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Eh?"</said> he said in a grumpy voice. <said
                  who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"What are you talking about?"</said></p>
            <p>She said it all over again. This was one of the worst parts of her job, for each time
               she said it, it sounded less convincing.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Aslan!"</said> said Edmund, jumping up.
                  <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Hurray! Where?"</said></p>
            <p>Lucy turned back to where she could see the Lion waiting, his patient eyes fixed upon
               her. <said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"There,"</said> she said, pointing.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Where?"</said> asked Edmund again.</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"There. There. Don't you see? Just this side
                  of the trees."</said></p>
            <p>Edmund stared hard for a while and then said, <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="lp"
                  >"No. There's nothing there. You've got dazzled and muddled with the moonlight.
                  One does, you know. I thought I saw something for a moment myself. It's only an
                  optical what-do-you-call-it."</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"I can see him all the time,"</said> said
               Lucy. <said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"He's looking straight at
               us."</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Then why can't I see him?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"He said you mightn't be able to."</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Why?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"I don't know. That's what he
               said."</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Oh, bother it all,"</said> said Edmund.
                  <said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"I do wish you wouldn't keep on seeing
                  things. But I suppose we'll have to wake the others."</said></p>

            <head>The Lion Roars</head>
            <p>When the whole party was finally awake Lucy had to tell her story for the fourth
               time. The blank silence which followed it was as discouraging as anything could
               be.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"I can't see anything,"</said> said

            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"No, of course I can't,"</said> snapped
               Susan. <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Because there isn't anything to see.
                  She's been dreaming.</said>
               <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">Do lie down and go to sleep,
               Lucy."</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"And I do hope,"</said> said Lucy in a
               tremulous voice, <said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep">"that you will all
                  come with me. Because--because I'll have to go with him whether anyone else does
                  or not."</said></p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Don't talk nonsense, Lucy,"</said> said
               Susan. <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Of course you can't go off on your
                  own.</said>
               <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">Don't let her, Peter. She's being downright
                  naughty."</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"I'll go with her, if she <emph

                  toWhom="sp sp lp">"She's been right before."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"I know she has,"</said> said Peter.
                  <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"And she may have been right this
                  morning. We certainly had no luck going down the gorge. Still--at this hour of the
                  night. And why should Aslan be invisible to us? He never used to be. It's not like
                  him.</said>
               <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">What does the D.L.F. say?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"Oh, I say nothing at
                  all,"</said> answered the Dwarf. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"If you all go, of course, I'll go with you; and if your
                  party splits up, I'll go with the High King. That's my duty to him and King
                  Caspian. But, if you ask my private opinion, I'm a plain dwarf who doesn't think
                  there's much chance of finding a road by night where you couldn't find one by day.
                  And I have no use for magic lions which are talking lions and don't talk, and
                  friendly lions though they don't do us any good, and whopping big lions though
                  nobody can see them. It's all bilge and beanstalks as far as I can
               see."</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep trumpkin">"He's beating his paw on the
                  ground for us to hurry,"</said> said Lucy. <said who="lp" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp sp ep trumpkin">"We must go <emph rend="italic">now</emph>. At least I
                  must."</said></p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"You've no right to try to force the rest of
                  us like that. It's four to one and you're the youngest,"</said> said Susan.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp trumpkin">"Oh, come on,"</said> growled
               Edmund. <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp trumpkin">"We've got to go.
                  There'll be no peace till we do."</said> He fully intended to back Lucy up, but he
               was annoyed at losing his night's sleep and was making up for it by doing everything
               as sulkily as possible.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp trumpkin">"On the march, then,"</said>
               said Peter, wearily fitting his arm into his shield-strap and putting his helmet on.
               At any other time he would have said something nice to Lucy, who was his favourite
               sister, for he knew how wretched she must be feeling, and he knew that, whatever had
               happened, it was not her fault. But he couldn't help being a little annoyed with her
               all the same.</p>
            <p>Susan was the worst. <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp trumpkin"
                  >"Supposing <emph rend="italic">I</emph> started behaving like Lucy,"</said> she
               said. <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep lp trumpkin">"I might threaten to
                  stay here whether the rest of you went on or not. I jolly well think I
                  shall."</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"Obey the High King, your
                  Majesty,"</said> said Trumpkin, <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"and let's be off. If I'm not to be allowed to sleep, I'd as
                  soon march as stand here talking."</said></p>
            <p>And so at last they got on the move. Lucy went first, biting her lip and trying not
               to say all the things she thought of saying to Susan. But she forgot them when she
               fixed her eyes on Aslan. He turned and walked at a slow pace about thirty yards ahead
               of them. The others had only Lucy's directions to guide them, for Aslan was not only
               invisible to them but silent as well. His big cat-like paws made no noise on the
               grass.</p>
            <p>He led them to the right of the dancing trees--whether they were still dancing nobody
               knew, for Lucy had her eyes on the Lion and the rest had their eyes on Lucy--and
               nearer the edge of the gorge. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="false">"Cobbles and
                  kettle-drums!"</said> thought Trumpkin. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="false">"I hope
                  this madness isn't going to end in a moonlight climb and broken necks."</said></p>
            <p>For a long way Aslan went along the top of the precipices. Then they came to a place
               where some little trees grew right on the edge. He turned and disappeared among them.
               Lucy held her breath, for it looked as if he had plunged over the cliff; but she was
               too busy keeping him in sight to stop and think about this. She quickened her pace
               and was soon among the trees herself. Looking down, she could see a steep and narrow
               path going slant-wise down into the gorge between rocks, and Aslan descending it. He
               turned and looked at her with his happy eyes. Lucy clapped her hands and began to
               scramble down after him. From behind her she heard the voices of the others shouting,
                  <said who="pp sp ep trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Hi! Lucy! Look out, for
                  goodness' sake. You're right on the edge of the gorge. Come back----"</said> and
               then, a moment later, Edmund's voice saying, <said who="ep" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp sp trumpkin">"No, she's right. There is a way down."</said></p>
            <p>Half-way down the path Edmund caught up with her.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp trumpkin">"Look!"</said> he said in
               great excitement. <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp trumpkin">"Look!
                  What's that shadow crawling down in front of us?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep trumpkin">"It's <emph rend="italic"
                     >his</emph> shadow,"</said> said Lucy.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"I do believe you're right, Lu,"</said> said
               Edmund. <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"I can't think how I didn't see it
                  before. But where is he?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"With his shadow, of course. Can't you see
                  him?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Well, I almost thought I did--for a moment.
                  It's such a rum light."</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"Get on, King Edmund, get on,"</said>
               came Trumpkin's voice from behind and above: and then, farther behind and still
               nearly at the top, Peter's voice saying, <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"Oh,
                  buck up, Susan. Give me your hand. Why, a baby could get down here. And do stop
                  grousing."</said></p>
            <p>In a few minutes they were at the bottom and the roaring of water filled their ears.
               Treading delicately, like a cat, Aslan stepped from stone to stone across the stream.
               In the middle he stopped, bent down to drink, and as he raised his shaggy head,
               dripping from the water, he turned to face them again. This time Edmund saw him.
                  <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Oh, Aslan!"</said> he cried, darting
               forward. But the Lion whisked round and began padding up the slope on the far side of
               the Rush.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Peter, Peter,"</said> cried Edmund. <said
                  who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Did you see?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"I saw something,"</said> said Peter. <said
                  who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"But it's so tricky in this moonlight. On we go,
                  though, and three cheers for Lucy. I don't feel half so tired now,
               either."</said></p>
            <p>Aslan without hesitation led them to their left, farther up the gorge. The whole
               journey was odd and dream-like--the roaring stream, the wet grey grass, the
               glimmering cliffs which they were approaching, and always the glorious, silently
               pacing Beast ahead. Everyone except Susan and the Dwarf could see him now.</p>
            <p>Presently they came to another steep path, up the face of the further precipices.
               These were far higher than the ones they had just descended, and the journey up them
               was a long and tedious zig-zag. Fortunately the Moon shone right above the gorge so
               that neither side was in shadow.</p>
            <p>Lucy was nearly blown when the tail and hind legs of Aslan disappeared over the top:
               but with one last effort she scrambled after him and came out, rather shaky-legged
               and breathless, on the hill they had been trying to reach ever since they left
               Glasswater. The long gentle slope (heather and grass and a few very big rocks that
               shone white in the moonlight) stretched up to where it vanished in a glimmer of trees
               about half a mile away. She knew it. It was the hill of the Stone Table.</p>
            <p>With a jingling of mail the others climbed up behind her. Aslan glided on before them
               and they walked after him.</p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Lucy,"</said> said Susan in a very small
               voice.</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"Yes?"</said> said Lucy.</p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"I see him now. I'm sorry."</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"That's all right."</said></p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"But I've been far worse than you know. I
                  really believed it was him--he, I mean--yesterday. When he warned us not to go
                  down to the fir wood. And I really believed it was him to-night, when you woke us
                  up. I mean, deep down inside. Or I could have, if I'd let myself. But I just
                  wanted to get out of the woods and--and--oh, I don't know. And what ever am I to
                  say to him?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"Perhaps you won't need to say much,"</said>
               suggested Lucy.</p>
            <p>Soon they reached the trees and through them the children could see the Great Mound,
               Aslan's How, which had been raised over the Table since their days.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"Our side don't keep very good
                  watch,"</said> muttered Trumpkin. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"We ought to have been challenged before now----"</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp sp ep lp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"Hush!"</said> said the other
               four, for now Aslan had stopped and turned and stood facing them, looking so majestic
               that they felt as glad as anyone can who feels afraid, and as afraid as anyone can
               who feels glad. The boys strode forward: Lucy made way for them: Susan and the Dwarf
               shrank back.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Oh, Aslan,"</said> said King Peter,
               dropping on one knee and raising the Lion's heavy paw to his face, <said who="pp"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"I'm so glad. And I'm so sorry. I've been leading them
                  wrong ever since we started and especially yesterday morning."</said></p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"My dear son,"</said> said Aslan.</p>
            <p>Then he turned and welcomed Edmund. <said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"Well
                  done,"</said> were his words.</p>
            <p>Then, after an awful pause, the deep voice said, <said who="aslan" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="sp">"Susan."</said> Susan made no answer but the others thought she was
               crying. <said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"You have listened to fears,
                  child,"</said> said Aslan. <said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"Come, let
                  me breathe on you. Forget them. Are you brave again?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"A little, Aslan,"</said> said Susan.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp trumpkin">"And now!"</said> said
               Aslan in a much louder voice with just a hint of a roar in it, while his tail lashed
               his flanks. <said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp">"And now, where is
                  this little Dwarf, this famous swordsman and archer, who doesn't believe in
                  lions?</said>
               <said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">Come here, son of Earth, come
                  HERE!"</said>--and the last word was no longer the hint of a roar but almost the
               real thing.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Wraiths and wreckage!"</said>
               gasped Trumpkin in the ghost of a voice. The children, who knew Aslan well enough to
               see that he liked the Dwarf very much, were not disturbed; but it was quite another
               thing for Trumpkin, who had never seen a lion before, let alone this Lion. He did the
               only sensible thing he could have done; that is, instead of bolting, he tottered
               towards Aslan.</p>
            <p>Aslan pounced. Have you ever seen a very young kitten being carried in the mother
               cat's mouth? It was like that. The Dwarf, hunched up in a little, miserable ball,
               hung from Aslan's mouth. The Lion gave him one shake and all his armour rattled like
               a tinker's pack and then--hey-presto--the Dwarf flew up in the air. He was as safe as
               if he had been in bed, though he did not feel so. As he came down the huge velvety
               paws caught him as gently as a mother's arms and set him (right way up, too) on the
               ground.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"Son of Earth, shall we be
                  friends?"</said> asked Aslan.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"Ye--he--he--hes,"</said> panted the
               Dwarf, for it had not yet got its breath back.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp trumpkin">"Now,"</said> said
               Aslan. <said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp ep lp trumpkin">"The Moon is
                  setting. Look behind you: there is the dawn beginning. We have no time to
                  lose.</said>
               <said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="pp ep trumpkin">You three, you sons of Adam
                  and son of Earth, hasten into the Mound and deal with what you will find
                  there."</said></p>
            <p>The Dwarf was still speechless and neither of the boys dared to ask if Aslan would
               follow them. All three drew their swords and saluted, then turned and jingled away
               into the dusk. Lucy noticed that there was no sign of weariness in their faces: both
               the High King and King Edmund looked more like men than boys.</p>
            <p>The girls watched them out of sight, standing close beside Aslan. The light was
               changing. Low down in the east, Aravir, the morning star of Narnia, gleamed like a
               little moon. Aslan, who seemed larger than before, lifted his head, shook his mane
               and roared.</p>
            <p>The sound, deep and throbbing at first like an organ beginning on a low note, rose
               and became louder, and then far louder again, till the earth and air were shaking
               with it. It rose up from that hill and floated across all Narnia. Down in Miraz's
               camp men woke, stared palely in one another's faces, and grasped their weapons. Down
               below that in the Great River, now at its coldest hour, the heads and shoulders of
               the nymphs, and the great weedy-bearded head of the river-god, rose from the water.
               Beyond it, in every field and wood, the alert ears of rabbits rose from their holes,
               the sleepy heads of birds came out from under wings, owls hooted, vixens barked,
               hedgehogs grunted, the trees stirred. In towns and villages mothers pressed babies
               close to their breasts, staring with wild eyes, dogs whimpered, and men leaped up
               groping for lights. Far away on the northern frontier the mountain giants peered from
               the dark gateways of their castles.</p>
            <p>What Lucy and Susan saw was a dark something coming to them from almost every
               direction across the hills. It looked first like a black mist creeping on the ground,
               then like the stormy waves of a black sea rising higher and higher as it came on, and
               then, at last, like what it was--woods on the move. All the trees of the world
               appeared to be rushing towards Aslan. But as they drew nearer they looked less like
               trees, and when the whole crowd, bowing and curtsying and waving thin long arms to
               Aslan, were all around Lucy, she saw that it was a crowd of human shapes. Pale
               birch-girls were tossing their heads, willow-women pushed back their hair from their
               brooding faces to gaze on Aslan, the queenly beeches stood still and adored him,
               shaggy oak-men, lean and melancholy elms, shock-headed hollies (dark themselves, but
               their wives all bright with berries) and gay rowans, all bowed and rose again,
               shouting, <said who="savedtrees" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Aslan, Aslan!"</said>
               in their various husky or creaking or wave-like voices.</p>
            <p>The crowd and the dance round Aslan (for it had become a dance once more) grew so
               thick and rapid that Lucy was confused. She never saw where certain other people came
               from who were soon capering about among the trees. One was a youth, dressed only in a
               fawn-skin, with vine-leaves wreathed in his curly hair. His face would have been
               almost too pretty for a boy's, if it had not looked so extremely wild. You felt, as
               Edmund said when he saw him a few days later, <said who="ep" aloud="true">"There's a
                  chap who might do anything--absolutely anything."</said> He seemed to have a great
               many names--Bromios, Bassareus, and the Ram were three of them. There were a lot of
               girls with him, as wild as he. There was even, unexpectedly, someone on a donkey. And
               everybody was laughing: and every body was shouting out, "Euan, euan,
               eu-oi-oi-oi."</p>
            <p><said who="bacchus" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Is it a Romp, Aslan?"</said> cried
               the youth. And apparently it was. But nearly everyone seemed to have a different idea
               as to what they were playing. It may have been Tig, but Lucy never discovered who was
               It. It was rather like Blind Man's Buff, only everyone behaved as if they were
               blindfolded. It was not unlike Hunt the Slipper, but the slipper was never found.
               What made it more complicated was that the man on the donkey, who was old and
               enormously fat, began calling out at once, <said who="silenus" aloud="true"
                  >"Refreshments! Time for refreshments,"</said> and falling off his donkey and
               being bundled on to it again by the others, while the donkey was under the impression
               that the whole thing was a circus, and tried to give a display of walking on its hind
               legs. And all the time there were more and more vine leaves everywhere. And soon not
               only leaves but vines. They were climbing up everything. They were running up the
               legs of the tree people and circling round their necks. Lucy put up her hands to push
               back her hair and found she was pushing back vine branches. The donkey was a mass of
               them. His tail was completely entangled and something dark was nodding between his
               ears. Lucy looked again and saw it was a bunch of grapes. After that it was mostly
               grapes--overhead and underfoot and all around.</p>
            <p><said who="silenus" aloud="true">"Refreshments! Refreshments,"</said> roared the old
               man. Everyone began eating, and whatever hothouses your people may have, you have
               never tasted such grapes. Really good grapes, firm and tight on the outside, but
               bursting into cool sweetness when you put them into your mouth, were one of the
               things the girls had never had quite enough of before. Here, there were more than
               anyone could possibly want, and no table-manners at all. One saw sticky and stained
               fingers everywhere, and, though mouths were full, the laughter never ceased nor the
               yodelling cries of <emph rend="italic">Euan, euan, eu-oi-oi-oi-oi</emph>, till all of
               a sudden everyone felt at the same moment that the game (whatever it was), and the
               feast, ought to be over, and everyone flopped down breathless on the ground and
               turned their faces to Aslan to hear what he would say next.</p>
            <p>At that moment the sun was just rising and Lucy remembered something and whispered to
               Susan,</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"I say, Su, I know who they are."</said></p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Who?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"The boy with the wild face is Bacchus and
                  the old one on the donkey is Silenus. Don't you remember Mr Tumnus telling us
                  about them long ago?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Yes, of course. But I say,
               Lu----"</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"What?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"I wouldn't have felt very safe with Bacchus
                  and all his wild girls if we'd met them without Aslan."</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"I should think not,"</said> said Lucy.</p>

            <head>Sorcery and Sudden Vengeance</head>
            <p>Meanwhile Trumpkin and the two boys arrived at the dark little stone archway which
               led into the inside of the Mound, and two sentinel badgers (the white patches on
               their cheeks were all Edmund could see of them) leaped up with bared teeth and asked
               them in snarling voices, <said who="sentinelbadgers" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp ep trumpkin">"Who goes there?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="sentinelbadgers">"Trumpkin,"</said> said
               the Dwarf. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="sentinelbadgers">"Bringing the
                  High King of Narnia out of the far past."</said></p>
            <p>The badgers nosed at the boys' hands. <said who="sentinelbadgers" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="trumpkin">"At last,"</said> they said. <said who="sentinelbadgers"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"At last."</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="sentinelbadgers">"Give us a light,
                  friends,"</said> said Trumpkin.</p>
            <p>The badgers found a torch just inside the arch and Peter lit it and handed it to
               Trumpkin. <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep trumpkin">"The D.L.F. had better
                  lead,"</said> he said. <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep trumpkin">"We don't
                  know our way about this place."</said></p>
            <p>Trumpkin took the torch and went ahead into the dark tunnel. It was a cold, black,
               musty place, with an occasional bat fluttering in the torchlight, and plenty of
               cobwebs. The boys, who had been mostly in the open air since that morning at the
               railway station, felt as if they were going into a trap or a prison.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"I say, Peter,"</said> whispered Edmund.
                  <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Look at those carvings on the walls.
                  Don't they look old? And yet we're older than that. When we were last here, they

            <p>The Dwarf went on ahead and then turned to the right, and then to the left, and then
               down some steps, and then to the left again. Then at last they saw a light
               ahead--light from under a door. And now for the first time they heard voices, for
               they had come to the door of the central chamber. The voices inside were angry ones.
               Someone was talking so loudly that the approach of the boys and the Dwarf had not
               been heard.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Don't like the sound of that,"</said>
               whispered Trumpkin to Peter. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Let's

                  And anyway, he was in Narnia only once that I ever heard of, and he didn't stay

            <p>Above the steadily increasing growl of the Badger and Cornelius's sharp <said
                  who="drcorn" aloud="true">"What?"</said> rose the voice of King Caspian like

            <p>The next minute or so was very confused. There was an animal roaring, a clash of
               steel; the boys and Trumpkin rushed in; Peter had a glimpse of a horrible, grey,
               gaunt creature, half man and half wolf, in the very act of leaping upon a boy about
               his own age, and Edmund saw a badger and a Dwarf rolling on the floor in a sort of
               cat fight. Trumpkin found himself face to face with the Hag. Her nose and chin stuck
               out like a pair of nut-crackers, her dirty grey hair was flying about her face and
               she had just got Doctor Cornelius by the throat. At one slash of Trumpkin's sword her
               head rolled on the floor. Then the light was knocked over and it was all swords,
               teeth, claws, fists and boots for about sixty seconds. Then silence.</p>

            <p>They all heard the noise of someone striking a match. It was Edmund. The little flame
               showed his face, looking pale and dirty. He blundered about for a little, found the
               candle (they were no longer using the lamp, for they had run out of oil), set it on
               the table and lit it. When the flame rose clear, several people scrambled to their
               feet. Six faces blinked at one another in the candlelight.</p>

               another voice at Peter's elbow. He turned and found himself face to face with the
               Badger. Peter leaned forward, put his arms round the beast and kissed the furry head:
               it wasn't a girlish thing for him to do, because he was the High King.</p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="trufflehunter">"Best of badgers,"</said> he said.

               and bandaging the wound took a little time, and when it was done Trumpkin said, <said

            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"No,"</said> said Caspian with a shudder.
                  <said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"And we must send someone to take away the

            <p>They breakfasted at last in another of the dark cellars of Aslan's How. It was not
               such a breakfast as they would have chosen, for Caspian and Cornelius were thinking
               of venison pasties, and Peter and Edmund of buttered eggs and hot coffee, but what
               everyone got was a little bit of cold bear-meat (out of the boys' pockets), a lump of
               hard cheese, an onion, and a mug of water. But, from the way they fell to, anyone
               would have supposed it was delicious.</p>

                  on a combat."</said></p>
            <p><said who="glozelle" aloud="true" toWhom="sopespian">"He might be brought to
                  it,"</said> said Glozelle in a much lower voice.</p>
            <p><said who="sopespian" aloud="true" toWhom="glozelle">"Softly,"</said> said Sopespian.
                  <said who="sopespian" aloud="true" toWhom="glozelle">"Step a little aside here out
                  of earshot of those sentries. Now. Have I taken your Lordship's meaning
                  aright?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="glozelle" aloud="true" toWhom="sopespian">"If the King undertook wager of
                  battle,"</said> whispered Glozelle, <said who="glozelle" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="sopespian">"why, either he would kill or be killed."</said></p>
            <p><said who="sopespian" aloud="true" toWhom="glozelle">"So,"</said> said Sopespian,
               nodding his head.</p>
            <p><said who="glozelle" aloud="true" toWhom="sopespian">"And if he killed we should have
                  won this war."</said></p>
            <p><said who="sopespian" aloud="true" toWhom="glozelle">"Certainly. And if
               not?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="glozelle" aloud="true" toWhom="sopespian">"Why, if not, we should be as
                  able to win it without the King's grace as with him. For I need not tell your
                  Lordship that Miraz is no very great captain. And after that, we should be both
                  victorious and kingless."</said></p>
            <p><said who="sopespian" aloud="true" toWhom="glozelle">"And it is your meaning, my
                  Lord, that you and I could hold this land quite as conveniently without a King as
                  with one?"</said></p>
            <p>Glozelle's face grew ugly. <said who="glozelle" aloud="true" toWhom="sopespian">"Not
                  forgetting,"</said> said he, <said who="glozelle" aloud="true" toWhom="sopespian"
                  >"that it was we who first put him on the throne. And in all the years that he has
                  enjoyed it, what fruits have come our way? What gratitude has he shown
               us?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="sopespian" aloud="true" toWhom="glozelle">"Say no more,"</said> answered
               Sopespian. <said who="sopespian" aloud="true" toWhom="glozelle">"But look--here comes
                  one to fetch us to the King's tent."</said></p>
            <p>When they reached Miraz's tent they saw Edmund and his two companions seated outside
               it and being entertained with cakes and wine, having already delivered the challenge,
               and withdrawn while the King was considering it. When they saw them thus at close
               quarters the two Telmarine lords thought all three of them very alarming.</p>
            <p>Inside, they found Miraz, unarmed and finishing his breakfast. His face was flushed
               and there was a scowl on his brow.</p>
            <p><said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="glozelle sopespian">"There!"</said> he
               growled, flinging the parchment across the table to them. <said who="miraz"

            <p><said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="glozelle">"King Edmund, pah!"</said> said
               Miraz. <said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="glozelle">"Does your Lordship believe

            <p><said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="glozelle sopespian">"Well, this is to no
                  purpose," said Miraz, "but as touching the challenge, I suppose there is only one
                  opinion between us?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="glozelle" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz">"I suppose so, indeed, Sire,"</said>
               said Glozelle.</p>
            <p><said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="glozelle sopespian">"And what is that?"</said>
               asked the King.</p>
            <p><said who="glozelle" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz">"Most infallibly to refuse
                  it,"</said> said Glozelle. <said who="glozelle" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz">"For
                  though I have never been called a coward, I must plainly say that to meet that
                  young man in battle is more than my heart would serve me for. And if (as is
                  likely) his brother, the High King, is more dangerous than he--why, on your life,
                  my Lord King, have nothing to do with him."</said></p>
            <p><said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="glozelle">"Plague on you!"</said> cried Miraz.
                  <said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="glozelle">"It was not that sort of council
                  I wanted. Do you think I am asking you if I should be afraid to meet this Peter
                  (if there is such a man)? Do you think I fear him? I wanted your counsel on the
                  policy of the matter; whether we, having the advantage, should hazard it on a
                  wager of battle."</said></p>
            <p><said who="glozelle" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz">"To which I can only answer, your
                  Majesty,"</said> said Glozelle, <said who="glozelle" aloud="true" toWhom="miraza"
                  >"that for all reasons the challenge should be refused. There is death in the
                  strange knight's face."</said></p>
            <p><said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="glozelle">"There you are again!"</said> said
               Miraz, now thoroughly angry. <said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="glozelle">"Are
                  you trying to make it appear that I am as great a coward as your
               Lordship?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="glozelle" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz">"Your Majesty may say your
                  pleasure,"</said> said Glozelle sulkily.</p>
            <p><said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="glozelle">"You talk like an old woman,
                  Glozelle,"</said> said the King. <said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="sopespian"
                  >"What say you, my Lord Sopespian?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="sopespian" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz">"Do not touch it, Sire,"</said> was
               the reply. <said who="sopespian" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz">"And what your Majesty
                  says of the policy of the thing comes in very happily. It gives your Majesty
                  excellent grounds for a refusal without any cause for questioning your Majesty's
                  honour or courage."</said></p>
            <p><said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="sopespian">"Great Heaven!" exclaimed Miraz,
                  jumping to his feet. "Are you also bewitched to-day? Do you think I am looking for
                  grounds to refuse it? You might as well call me coward to my face."</said></p>
            <p>The conversation was going exactly as the two lords wished, so they said nothing.</p>
            <p><said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="glozelle sopespian">"I see what it is,"</said>
               said Miraz, after staring at them as if his eyes would start out of his head, <said
                  who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="glozelle sopespian">"you are as lily-livered as
                  hares yourselves and have the effrontery to imagine my heart after the likeness of
                  yours! Grounds for a refusal, indeed! Excuses for not fighting! Are you soldiers?
                  Are you Telmarines? Are you men? And if I do refuse it (as all good reasons of
                  captaincy and martial policy urge me to do) you will think, and teach others to
                  think, I was afraid. Is it not so?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="glozelle" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz">"No man of your Majesty's
                  age,"</said> said Glozelle, <said who="glozelle" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz"
                  >"would be called coward by any wise soldier for refusing the combat with a great
                  warrior in the flower of his youth."</said></p>
            <p><said who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="glozelle sopespian">"So I'm to be a dotard
                  with one foot in the grave, as well as a dastard,"</said> roared Miraz. <said
                  who="miraz" aloud="true" toWhom="glozelle sopespian">"I'll tell you what it is, my
                  Lords. With your womanish counsels (ever shying from the true point, which is one
                  of policy) you have done the very opposite of your intent. I had meant to refuse
                  it. But I'll accept it. Do you hear, accept it! I'll not be shamed because some
                  witchcraft or treason has frozen both your bloods."</said></p>
            <p><said who="glozelle" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz">"We beseech your Majesty----"</said>
               said Glozelle, but Miraz had flung out of the tent and they could hear him bawling
               out his acceptance to Edmund.</p>
            <p>The two lords looked at one another and chuckled quietly.</p>
            <p><said who="glozelle" aloud="true" toWhom="sopespian">"I knew he'd do it if he were
                  properly chafed,"</said> said Glozelle. <said who="glozelle" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="sopespian">"But I'll not forget he called me coward. It shall be paid
                  for."</said></p>
            <p>There was a great stirring at Aslan's How when the news came back and was
               communicated to the various creatures. Edmund, with one of Miraz's captains, had
               already marked out the place for the combat, and ropes and stakes had been put round
               it. Two Telmarines were to stand at two of the corners, and one in the middle of one
               side, as marshals of the lists. Three marshals for the other two corners and the
               other side were to be furnished by the High King. Peter was just explaining to
               Caspian that he could not be one, because his right to the throne was what they were
               fighting about, when suddenly a thick, sleepy voice said, <said who="threebbs"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Your Majesty, please."</said> Peter turned and there
               stood the eldest of the Bulgy Bears. <said who="threebbs" aloud="true" toWhom="pp"
                  >"If you please, your Majesty,"</said> he said, <said who="threebbs" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp">"I'm a bear, I am."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="threebbs">"To be sure, so you are, and a good
                  bear too, I don't doubt,"</said> said Peter.</p>
            <p><said who="threebbs" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Yes,"</said> said the Bear. <said
                  who="threebbs" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"But it was always a right of the bears to
                  supply one marshal of the lists."</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Don't let him,"</said> whispered
               Trumpkin to Peter. <said who="threebbs" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"He's a good
                  creature, but he'll shame us all. He'll go to sleep and he will suck his paws. In
                  front of the enemy too."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"I can't help that,"</said> said Peter.
                  <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="trumpkin">"Because he's quite right. The Bears
                  had that privilege. I can't imagine how it has been remembered all these years,
                  when so many other things have been forgotten."</said></p>
            <p><said who="threebbs" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Please, your Majesty,"</said> said the
               Bear.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="threebbs">"It is your right,"</said> said Peter.
                  <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="threebbs">"And you shall be one of the
                  marshals. But you must remember not to suck your paws."</said></p>
            <p><said who="threebbs" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Of course not,"</said> said the Bear
               in a very shocked voice.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="threebbs">"Why, you're doing it this
                  minute!"</said> bellowed Trumpkin.</p>
            <p>The Bear whipped his paw out of his mouth and pretended he hadn't heard.</p>
            <p><said who="rcheep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Sire!"</said> came a shrill voice from
               near the ground.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="rcheep">"Ah--Reepicheep!"</said> said Peter after
               looking up and down and round as people usually did when addressed by the Mouse.</p>
            <p><said who="rcheep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Sire,"</said> said Reepicheep. <said
                  who="rcheep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"My life is ever at your command, but my
                  honour is my own. Sire, I have among my people the only trumpeter in your
                  Majesty's army. I had thought, perhaps, we might have been sent with the
                  challenge. Sire, my people are grieved. Perhaps if it were your pleasure that I
                  should be a marshal of the lists, it would content them."</said></p>
            <p>A noise not unlike thunder broke out from somewhere overhead at this point, as Giant
               Wimbleweather burst into one of those not very intelligent laughs to which the nicer
               sorts of Giant are so liable. He checked himself at once and looked as grave as a
               turnip by the time Reepicheep discovered where the noise came from.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="rcheep">"I am afraid it would not do,"</said>
               said Peter very gravely. <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="rcheep">"Some humans are
                  afraid of mice----"</said></p>
            <p><said who="rcheep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"I had observed it, Sire,"</said> said
               Reepicheep.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="rcheep">"And it would not be quite fair to
                  Miraz,"</said> Peter continued, <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="rcheep">"to
                  have in sight anything that might abate the edge of his courage."</said></p>
            <p><said who="rcheep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Your Majesty is the mirror of
                  honour,"</said> said the Mouse with one of his admirable bows. <said who="rcheep"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"And on this matter we have but a single mind. ... I
                  thought I heard someone laughing just now. If anyone present wishes to make me the
                  subject of his wit, I am very much at his service--with my sword--whenever he has
                  leisure."</said></p>
            <p>An awful silence followed this remark, which was broken by Peter saying, <said

            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"I say,"</said> said Edmund as they walked
               away, <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"I suppose it is all right. I mean, I

            <head>How All Were Very Busy</head>
            <p>A little before two o'clock Trumpkin and the Badger sat with the rest of the
               creatures at the wood's edge looking across at the gleaming line of Miraz's army
               which was about two arrow-shots away. In between, a square space of level grass had
               been staked for the combat. At the two far corners stood Glozelle and Sopespian with
               drawn swords. At the near corners were Giant Wimbleweather and the Bulgy Bear, who in
               spite of all their warnings was sucking his paws and looking, to tell the truth,
               uncommonly silly. To make up for this, Glenstorm on the right of the lists,
               stock-still except when he stamped a hind hoof occasionally on the turf, looked much
               more imposing than the Telmarine baron who faced him on the left. Peter had just
               shaken hands with Edmund and the Doctor, and was now walking down to the combat. It
               was like the moment before the pistol goes at an important race, but very much
               worse.</p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="trufflehunter">"I wish Aslan had turned up

            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="trufflehunter">"Crows and crockery!"</said>
               muttered the Dwarf as soon as he had done so. <said who="trumpkin" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="trufflehunter">"What are they? Huge people--beautiful people--like gods
                  and goddesses and giants. Hundreds and thousands of them, closing in behind us.

                  useful if the enemy try any treachery. But it won't help the High King very much
                  if Miraz proves handier with his sword."</said></p>
            <p>The Badger said nothing, for now Peter and Miraz were entering the lists from
               opposite ends, both on foot, both in chain shirts, with helmets and shields. They
               advanced till they were close together. Both bowed and seemed to speak, but it was
               impossible to hear what they said. Next moment the two swords flashed in the
               sunlight. For a second the clash could be heard but it was immediately drowned
               because both armies began shouting like crowds at a football match.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Well done, Peter, oh, well done!"</said>
               shouted Edmund as he saw Miraz reel back a whole pace and a half. <said who="ep"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Follow it up, quick!"</said> And Peter did, and for a
               few seconds it looked as if the fight might be won. But then Miraz pulled himself
               together--began to make real use of his height and weight. <said who="telmarines"
                  aloud="true">"Miraz! Miraz! The King! The King!"</said> came the roar of the
               Telmarines. Caspian and Edmund grew white with sickening anxiety.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pc trufflehunter trumpkin">"Peter is taking some
                  dreadful knocks,"</said> said Edmund.</p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"Hullo!" said Caspian. "What's happening
                  now?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Both falling apart,"</said> said Edmund.
                  <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"A bit blown, I expect. Watch. Ah, now
                  they're beginning again, more scientifically this time. Circling round and round,
                  feeling each other's defences."</said></p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="ep pc trumpkin trufflehunter">"I'm afraid
                  this Miraz knows his work,"</said> muttered the Doctor. But hardly had he said
               this when there was such a clapping and baying and throwing up of hoods among the Old
               Narnians that it was nearly deafening.</p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="ep pc trumpkin trufflehunter">"What was it?
                  What was it?"</said> asked the Doctor. <said who="drcorn" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="ep pc trumpkin trufflehunter">"My old eyes missed it."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="ep drcorn trumpkin trufflehunter">"The High King
                  has pricked him in the arm-pit,"</said> said Caspian, still clapping. <said
                  who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="ep drcorn trumpkin trufflehunter">"Just where the
                  arm-hole of the hauberk let the point through. First blood."</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pc drcorn trumpkin trufflehunter">"It's looking
                  ugly again now, though,"</said> said Edmund. <said who="ep" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pc drcorn trumpkin trufflehunter">"Peter's not using his shield properly.
                  He must be hurt in the left arm."</said></p>
            <p>It was only too true. Everyone could see that Peter's shield hung limp. The shouting
               of the Telmarines redoubled.</p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"You've seen more battles than I,"</said>
               said Caspian. <said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="ep ">"Is there any chance
                  now?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Precious little,"</said> said Edmund. <said
                  who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"I suppose he might <emph rend="italic"
                     >just</emph> do it. With luck."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"Oh, why did we let it happen at all?"</said>
               said Caspian.</p>
            <p>Suddenly all the shouting on both sides died down. Edmund was puzzled for a moment.
               Then he said, <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pc drcorn trumpkin truffleunter"
                  >"Oh, I see. They've both agreed to a rest.</said>
               <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">Come on, Doctor. You and I may be able to
                  do something for the High King."</said> They ran down to the lists and Peter came
               outside the ropes to meet them, his face red and sweaty, his chest heaving.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Is your left arm wounded?"</said> asked
               Edmund.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"It's not exactly a wound,"</said> Peter
               said. <said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"I got the full weight of his shoulder
                  on my shield--like a load of bricks--and the rim of the shield drove into my
                  wrist. I don't think it's broken, but it might be a sprain. If you could tie it up
                  very tight I think I could manage."</said></p>
            <p>While they were doing this, Edmund asked anxiously, <said who="ep" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pp">"What do you think of him, Peter?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"Tough," </said>said Peter. <said who="pp"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"Very tough. I have a chance if I can keep him on the hop
                  till his weight and short wind come against him--in this hot sun too. To tell the
                  truth, I haven't much chance else. Give my love to--to everyone at home, Ed, if he
                  gets me. Here he comes into the lists again. So long, old chap. Good-bye, Doctor.
                  And I say, Ed, say something specially nice to Trumpkin. He's been a
                  brick."</said></p>
            <p>Edmund couldn't speak. He walked back with the Doctor to his own lines with a sick
               feeling in his stomach.</p>
            <p>But the new bout went well. Peter now seemed to be able to make some use of his
               shield, and he certainly made good use of his feet. He was almost playing Tig with
               Miraz now, keeping out of range, shifting his ground, making the enemy work.</p>
            <p><said who="telmarines" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Coward!"</said> booed the
               Telmarines. <said who="telmarines" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Why don't you stand up
                  to him? Don't you like it, eh? Thought you'd come to fight, not dance.
                  Yah!"</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="ep drcorn trumpkin trufflehunter">"Oh, I do hope
                  he won't listen to them,"</said> said Caspian.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pc drcorn trumpkin trufflehunter">"Not
                  he,"</said> said Edmund. <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"You don't know
                  him--Oh!"</said>--for Miraz had got in a blow at last, on Peter's helmet. Peter
               staggered, slipped sideways and fell on one knee. The roar of the Telmarines rose
               like the noise of the sea. <said who="telmarines" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz">"Now,
                  Miraz,"</said> they yelled. <said who="telmarines" aloud="true" toWhom="miraz"
                  >"Now. Quick! Quick! Kill him."</said> But indeed there was no need to egg the
               usurper on. He was on top of Peter already. Edmund bit his lips till the blood came,
               as the sword flashed down on Peter. It looked as if it would slash off his head.
               Thank heavens! it had glanced down his right shoulder. The Dwarf-wrought mail was
               sound and did not break.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pc drcorn trufflehunter trumpkin">"Great
                  Scott!"</said> cried Edmund. <said who="ep" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pc drcorn trufflehunter trumpkin">"He's up again.</said>
               <said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">Peter, go it, Peter."</said></p>
            <p><said who="drcorn" aloud="true" toWhom="pc ep trufflehunter trumpkin">"I couldn't see
                  what happened,"</said> said the Doctor. <said who="drcorn" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pc ep trufflehunter trumpkin">"How did he do it?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="trumpkin" aloud="true" toWhom="drcorn">"Grabbed Miraz's arm as it came
                  down,"</said> said Trumpkin, dancing with delight. <said who="trumpkin"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="pc ep trufflehunter drcorn">"There's a man for you! Uses his
                  enemy's arm as a ladder. The High King! The High King! Up, Old Narnia!"</said></p>
            <p><said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true" toWhom="pc ep drcorn trumpkin">"Look,"</said>
               said Trufflehunter. <said who="trufflehunter" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="pc ep drcorn trumpkin">"Miraz is angry. It is good."</said></p>
            <p>They were certainly at it hammer and tongs now: such a flurry of blows that it seemed
               impossible for either not to be killed. As the excitement grew, the shouting almost
               died away. The spectators were holding their breath. It was most horrible and most
               magnificent.</p>
            <p>A great shout arose from the Old Narnians. Miraz was down--not struck by Peter, but
               face downwards, having tripped on a tussock. Peter stepped back, waiting for him to
               rise.</p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="false">"Oh bother, bother, bother,"</said> said Edmund to
               himself. <said who="ep" aloud="false">"Need he be as gentlemanly as all that? I
                  suppose he must. Comes of being a Knight <emph rend="italic">and</emph> a High
                  King. I suppose it is what Aslan would like. But that brute will be up again in a
                  minute and then----"</said></p>
            <p>But "that brute" never rose. The Lords Glozelle and Sopespian had their own plans
               ready. As soon as they saw their King down they leaped into the lists crying, <said
                  who="glozelle sopespian" aloud="true">"Treachery! Treachery! The Narnian traitor
                  has stabbed him in the back while he lay helpless. To arms! To arms,
                  Telmar!"</said></p>
            <p>Peter hardly understood what was happening. He saw two big men running towards him
               with drawn swords. Then the third Telmarine had leaped over the ropes on his left.
                  <said who="pp" aloud="true">"To arms, Narnia! Treachery!"</said> Peter shouted. If
               all three had set upon him at once he would never have spoken again. But Glozelle
               stopped to stab his own King dead where he lay: "<said who="glozelle" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="miraz">That's for your insult, this morning,"</said> he whispered as the
               blade went home. Peter swung to face Sopespian, slashed his legs from under him and,
               with the back-cut of the same stroke, walloped off his head. Edmund was now at his
               side crying, <said who="ep" aloud="true">"Narnia, Narnia! The Lion!"</said> The whole
               Telmarine army was rushing towards them. But now the Giant was stamping forward,
               stooping low and swinging his club. The Centaurs charged. <emph rend="italic">Twang,
                  twang</emph> behind and <emph rend="italic">hiss, hiss</emph> overhead came the
               archery of Dwarfs. Trumpkin was fighting at his left. Full battle was joined.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="rcheep">"Come back, Reepicheep, you little
                  ass!"</said> shouted Peter. <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="rcheep">"You'll
                  only be killed. This is no place for mice."</said> But the ridiculous little
               creatures were dancing in and out among the feet of both armies, jabbing with their
               swords. Many a Telmarine warrior that day felt his foot suddenly pierced as if by a
               dozen skewers, hopped on one leg cursing the pain, and fell as often as not. If he
               fell, the mice finished him off; if he did not, someone else did.</p>
            <p>But almost before the old Narnians were really warmed to their work they found the
               enemy giving way. Tough-looking warriors turned white, gazed in terror not on the Old
               Narnians but on something behind them, and then flung down their weapons, shrieking,
                  <said who="telmarines" aloud="true">"The Wood! The Wood! The end of the
                  world!"</said></p>
            <p>But soon neither their cries nor the sound of weapons could be heard any more, for
               both were drowned in the ocean-like roar of the Awakened Trees as they plunged
               through the ranks of Peter's army, and then on, in pursuit of the Telmarines. Have
               you ever stood at the edge of a great wood on a high ridge when a wild south-wester
               broke over it in full fury on an autumn evening? Imagine that sound. And then imagine
               that the wood, instead of being fixed to one place, was rushing at you; and was no
               longer trees but huge people; yet still like trees because their long arms waved like
               branches and their heads tossed and leaves fell round them in showers. It was like
               that for the Telmarines. It was a little alarming even for the Narnians. In a few
               minutes all Miraz's followers were running down to the Great River in the hope of
               crossing the bridge to the town of Beruna and there defending themselves behind
               ramparts and closed gates.</p>
            <p>They reached the river, but there was no bridge. It had disappeared since yesterday.
               Then utter panic and horror fell upon them and they all surrendered.</p>
            <p>But what had happened to the bridge?</p>
            <p>Early that morning, after a few hours' sleep, the girls had waked, to see Aslan
               standing over them and to hear his voice saying, "We will make holiday." They rubbed
               their eyes and looked round them. The trees had all gone but could still be seen
               moving away towards Aslan's How in a dark mass. Bacchus and the Maenads--his fierce,
               madcap girls--and Silenus were still with them. Lucy, fully rested, jumped up.
               Everyone was awake, everyone was laughing, flutes were playing, cymbals clashing.
               Animals, not Talking Animals, were crowding in upon them from every direction.</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"What is it, Aslan?"</said> said Lucy, her
               eyes dancing and her feet wanting to dance.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="lp sp">"Come, children,"</said> said he. <said
                  who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="sp lp">"Ride on my back again to-day."</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Oh, lovely!"</said> cried Lucy, and both
               girls climbed on to the warm golden back as they had done no-one knew how many years
               before. Then the whole party moved off--Aslan leading, Bacchus and his Maenads
               leaping, rushing, and turning somersaults, the beasts frisking round them, and
               Silenus and his donkey bringing up the rear.</p>
            <p>They turned a little to the right, raced down a steep hill, and found the long Bridge
               of Beruna in front of them. Before they had begun to cross it, however, up out of the
               water came a great wet, bearded head, larger than a man's, crowned with rushes. It
               looked at Aslan and out of its mouth a deep voice came.</p>
            <p><said who="rivergod" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Hail, Lord,"</said> it said. <said
                  who="rivergod" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Loose my chains."</said></p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Who on earth is <emph rend="italic"
                     >that</emph>?"</said> whispered Susan.</p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"I think it's the river-god, but
                  hush,"</said> said Lucy.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="bacchus">"Bacchus,"</said> said Aslan. <said
                  who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="bacchus">"Deliver him from his
               chains."</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="false">"That means the bridge, I expect,"</said> thought Lucy.
               And so it did. Bacchus and his people splashed forward into the shallow water, and a
               minute later the most curious things began happening. Great, strong trunks of ivy
               came curling up all the piers of the bridge, growing as quickly as a fire grows,
               wrapping the stones round, splitting, breaking, separating them. The walls of the
               bridge turned into hedges gay with hawthorn for a moment and then disappeared as the
               whole thing with a rush and a rumble collapsed into the swirling water. With much
               splashing, screaming, and laughter the revellers waded or swam or danced across the
               ford (<said who="sp lp" aloud="true">"Hurrah! It's the Ford of Beruna again
                  now!"</said> cried the girls) and up the bank on the far side and into the
               town.</p>
            <p>Everyone in the streets fled before their faces. The first house they came to was a
               school: a girls' school, where a lot of Narnian girls, with their hair done very
               tight and ugly tight collars round their necks and thick tickly stockings on their
               legs, were having a history lesson. The sort of "History" that was taught in Narnia
               under Miraz's rule was duller than the truest history you ever read and less true
               than the most exciting adventure story.</p>
            <p><said who="frizzle" aloud="true" toWhom="gwendolen">"If you don't attend,
                  Gwendolen,"</said> said the mistress, <said who="telteacher" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="gwendolen">"and stop looking out of the window, I shall have to give you
                  an order-mark."</said></p>
            <p><said who="gwendolen" aloud="true" toWhom="frizzle">"But please, Miss
                  Frizzle----"</said> began Gwendolen.</p>
            <p><said who="frizzle" aloud="true" toWhom="gwendolen">"Did you hear what I said,
                  Gwendolen?"</said> asked Miss Frizzle.</p>
            <p><said who="gwendolen" aloud="true" toWhom="frizzle">"But please, Miss
                  Frizzle,"</said> said Gwendolen, <said who="gwendolen" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="frizzle">"there's a LION!"</said></p>
            <p><said who="frizzle" aloud="true" toWhom="gwendolen">"Take two order-marks for talking
                  nonsense,"</said> said Miss Frizzle. <said who="frizzle" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="gwendolen">"And now----"</said> A roar interrupted her. Ivy came curling
               in at the windows of the classroom. The walls became a mass of shimmering green, and
               leafy branches arched overhead where the ceiling had been. Miss Frizzle found she was
               standing on grass in a forest glade. She clutched at her desk to steady herself, and
               found that the desk was a rose-bush. Wild people such as she had never even imagined
               were crowding round her. Then she saw the Lion, screamed and fled, and with her fled
               her class, who were mostly dumpy, prim little girls with fat legs. Gwendolen
               hesitated.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="gwendolen">"You'll stay with us,
                  sweetheart?"</said> said Aslan.</p>
            <p><said who="gwendolen" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Oh, may I? Thank you, thank
                  you,"</said> said Gwendolen. Instantly she joined hands with two of the Maenads,
               who whirled her round in a merry dance and helped her take off some of the
               unnecessary and uncomfortable clothes that she was wearing.</p>
            <p>Wherever they went in the little town of Beruna it was the same. Most of the people
               fled, a few joined them. When they left the town they were a larger and a merrier
               company.</p>
            <p>They swept on across the level fields on the north bank, or left bank, of the river.
               At every farm animals came out to join them. Sad old donkeys who had never known joy
               grew suddenly young again; chained dogs broke their chains; horses kicked their carts
               to pieces and came trotting along with them--clop-clop--kicking up the mud and
               whinnying.</p>
            <p>At a well in a yard they met a man who was beating a boy. The stick burst into flower
               in the man's hand. He tried to drop it, but it stuck to his hand. His arm became a
               branch, his body the trunk of a tree, his feet took root. The boy, who had been
               crying a moment before, burst out laughing and joined them.</p>
            <p>At a little town half-way to Beaversdam, where two rivers met, they came to another
               school, where a tired-looking girl was teaching arithmetic to a number of boys who
               looked very like pigs. She looked out of the window and saw the divine revellers
               singing up the street and a stab of joy went through her heart. Aslan stopped right
               under the window and looked up at her.</p>
            <p><said who="telteacher" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Oh, don't, don't,"</said> she
               said. <said who="telteacher" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Oh, don't,
               don't,"</said>she said. <said who="telteacher" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"I'd love
                  to. But I mustn't. I must stick to my work. And the children would be frightened
                  if they saw you."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pigboy1" aloud="true" toWhom="pigboys">"Frightened?"</said> said the most
               pig-like of the boys. <said who="pigboy" aloud="true">"Who's she talking to out of
                  the window? Let's tell the inspector she talks to people out of the window when
                  she ought to be teaching us."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pigboy2" aloud="true" toWhom="pigboy1 pigboys">"Let's go and see who it
                  is,"</said> said another boy, and they all came crowding to the window. But as
               soon as their mean little faces looked out, Bacchus gave a great cry of <emph
                  rend="italic">Euan, euoi-oi-oi-oi</emph> and the boys all began howling with
               fright and trampling one another down to get out of the door and jumping out of the
               windows. And it was said afterwards (whether truly or not) that those particular
               little boys were never seen again, but that there were a lot of very fine little pigs
               in that part of the country which had never been there before.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="telteacher">"Now, Dear Heart,"</said> said
               Aslan to the Mistress: and she jumped down and joined them.</p>
            <p>At Beaversdam they re-crossed the river and came east again along the southern bank.
               They came to a little cottage where a child stood in the doorway crying. <said
                  who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="bdchild">"Why are you crying, my love?"</said>
               asked Aslan. The child, who had never even seen a picture of a lion, was not afraid
               of him. <said who="bdchild" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Auntie's very ill,"</said>
               she said. <said who="bdchild" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"She's going to
                  die."</said> Then Aslan went to go in at the door of the cottage, but it was too
               small for him. So, when he had got his head through, he pushed with his shoulders
               (Lucy and Susan fell off when he did this) and lifted the whole house up and it all
               fell backwards and apart. And there, still in her bed, though the bed was now in the
               open air, lay a little old woman who looked as if she had Dwarf blood in her. She was
               at death's door, but when she opened her eyes and saw the bright, hairy head of the
               lion staring into her face, she did not scream or faint. She said, <said
                  who="caspiannurse" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Oh, Aslan! I knew it was true.
                  I've been waiting for this all my life. Have you come to take me away?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="caspiannurse">"Yes, dearest,"</said> said
               Aslan. <said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="caspiannurse">"But not the long journey
                  yet."</said> And as he spoke, like the flush creeping along the underside of a
               cloud at sunrise, the colour came back to her white face and her eyes grew bright and
               she sat up and said, <said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="caspiannurse">"Why, I do
                  declare I feel <emph rend="italic">that</emph> better. I think I could take a
                  little breakfast this morning."</said></p>
            <p><said who="bacchus" aloud="true" toWhom="caspiannurse">"Here you are, mother,"</said>
               said Bacchus, dipping a pitcher in the cottage well and handing it to her. But what
               was in it now was not water but the richest wine, red as red-currant jelly, smooth as
               oil, strong as beef, warming as tea, cool as dew.</p>
            <p><said who="caspiannurse" aloud="true" toWhom="bacchus">"Eh, you've done something to
                  our well,"</said> said the old woman. <said who="caspiannurse" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="bacchus">"That makes a nice change, that does."</said> And she jumped out
               of bed.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="caspiannurse">"Ride on me,"</said> said Aslan,
               and added to Susan and Lucy, <said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="sp lp">"You two
                  queens will have to run now."</said></p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"But we'd like that just as well,"</said>
               said Susan. And off they went again.</p>
            <p>And so at last, with leaping and dancing and singing, with music and laughter and
               roaring and barking and neighing, they all came to the place where Miraz's army stood
               flinging down their swords and holding up their hands, and Peter's army, still
               holding their weapons and breathing hard, stood round them with stern and glad faces.
               And the first thing that happened was that the old woman slipped off Aslan's back and
               ran across to Caspian and they embraced one another; for she was his old nurse.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="chaptXer" n="15">
            <head>How Aslan Makes a Door in the Air</head>
            <p>At the sight of Aslan the cheeks of the Telmarine soldiers became the colour of cold
               gravy, their knees knocked together, and many fell on their faces. They had not
               believed in lions and this made their fear greater. Even the Red Dwarfs, who knew
               that he came as a friend, stood with open mouths and could not speak. Some of the
               Black Dwarfs, who had been of Nikabrik's party, began to edge away. But all the
               Talking Beasts surged round the Lion, with purrs and grunts and squeaks and whinneys
               of delight, fawning on him with their tails, rubbing against him, touching him
               reverently with their noses and going to and fro under his body and between his legs.
               If you have ever seen a little cat loving a big dog whom it knows and trusts, you
               will have a pretty good picture of their behaviour. Then Peter, leading Caspian,
               forced his way through the crowd of animals.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"This is Caspian, Sir,"</said> he said.
               And Caspian knelt and kissed the Lion's paw.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Welcome, Prince,"</said> said Aslan.
                  <said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Do you feel yourself sufficient to
                  take up the Kingship of Narnia?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"I--I don't think I do, Sir,"</said> said
               Caspian. <said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"I'm only a kid."</said></p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"Good,"</said> said Aslan. <said
                  who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"If you had felt yourself sufficient, it
                  would have been a proof that you were not. Therefore, under us and under the High
                  King, you shall be King of Narnia, Lord of Cair Paravel and Emperor of the Lone
                  Islands. You and your heirs while your race lasts. And your coronation--but what
                  have we here?"</said> For at that moment a curious little procession was
               approaching--eleven Mice, six of whom carried between them something on a litter made
               of branches, but the litter was no bigger than a large atlas. No-one has ever seen
               mice more woebegone than these. They were plastered with mud--some with blood
               too--and their ears were down and their whiskers drooped and their tails dragged in
               the grass, and their leader piped on his slender pipe a melancholy tune. On the
               litter lay what seemed little better than a damp heap of fur; all that was left of
               Reepicheep. He was still breathing, but more dead than alive, gashed with innumerable
               wounds, one paw crushed, and, where his tail had been, a bandaged stump.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Now, Lucy,"</said> said Aslan.</p>
            <p>Lucy had her diamond bottle out in a moment. Though only a drop was needed on each of
               Reepicheep's wounds, the wounds were so many that there was a long and anxious
               silence before she had finished and the Master Mouse sprang from the litter. His hand
               went at once to his sword hilt, with the other he twirled his whiskers. He bowed.</p>
            <p><said who="rcheep" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Hail, Aslan!"</said> came his shrill
               voice. <said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"I have the honour----"</said> But
               then he suddenly stopped.</p>
            <p>The fact was that he still had no tail--whether that Lucy had forgotten it or that
               her cordial, though it could heal wounds, could not make things grow again.
               Reepicheep became aware of his loss as he made his bow; perhaps it altered something
               in his balance. He looked over his right shoulder. Failing to see his tail, he
               strained his neck further till he had to turn his shoulders and his whole body
               followed. But by that time his hind quarters had turned too and were out of sight.
               Then he strained his neck looking over his shoulder again, with the same result. Only
               after he had turned completely round three times did he realise the dreadful
               truth.</p>
            <p><said who="rcheep" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"I am confounded,"</said> said
               Reepicheep to Aslan. <said who="rcheep" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"I am completely
                  out of countenance. I must crave your indulgence for appearing in this unseemly
                  fashion."</said></p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="rcheep">"It becomes you very well, Small
                  One,"</said> said Aslan.</p>
            <p><said who="rcheep" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"All the same,"</said> replied
               Reepicheep, <said who="rcheep" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"if anything could be done
                  ...</said>
               <said who="rcheep" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">Perhaps her Majesty?"</said> and here he
               bowed to Lucy.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="rcheep">"But what do you want with a
                  tail?"</said> asked Aslan.</p>
            <p><said who="rcheep" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Sir,"</said> said the Mouse, <said
                  who="rcheep" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"I can eat and sleep and die for my King
                  without one. But a tail is the honour and glory of a Mouse."</said></p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="rcheep">"I have sometimes wondered,
                  friend,"</said> said Aslan, <said who="rcheep" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan"
                  >"whether you do not think too much about your honour."</said></p>
            <p><said who="rcheep" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Highest of all High Kings,"</said>
               said Reepicheep, <said who="rcheep" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"permit me to remind
                  you that a very small size has been bestowed on us Mice, and if we did not guard
                  our dignity, some (who weigh worth by inches) would allow themselves very
                  unsuitable pleasantries at our expense. That is why I have been at some pains to
                  make it known that no-one who does not wish to feel this sword as near his heart
                  as I can reach shall talk in my presence about Traps or Toasted Cheese or Candles:
                  no, Sir--not the tallest fool in Narnia!"</said> Here he glared very fiercely up
               at Wimbleweather, but the Giant, who was always a stage behind everyone else, had not
               yet discovered what was being talked about down at his feet, and so missed the
               point.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="rcheep">"Why have your followers all drawn
                     <emph rend="italic">their</emph> swords, may I ask?"</said> said Aslan.</p>
            <p><said who="peepiceek" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"May it please your High
                  Majesty,"</said> said the second Mouse, whose name was Peepiceek, <said
                  who="peepiceek" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"we are all waiting to cut off our own
                  tails if our Chief must go without his. We will not bear the shame of wearing an
                  honour which is denied to the High Mouse."</said></p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="rcheep">"Ah!"</said> roared Aslan. <said
                  who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="rcheep">"You have conquered me. You have great
                  hearts. Not for the sake of your dignity, Reepicheep, but for the love that is
                  between you and your people, and still more for the kindness your people showed me
                  long ago when you ate away the cords that bound me on the Stone Table (and it was
                  then, though you have long forgotten it, that you began to be <emph rend="italic"
                     >Talking</emph> Mice), you shall have your tail again."</said></p>
            <p>Before Aslan had finished speaking the new tail was in its place. Then, at Aslan's
               command, Peter bestowed the Knighthood of the Order of the Lion on Caspian, and
               Caspian, as soon as he was knighted, himself bestowed it on Trufflehunter and
               Trumpkin and Reepicheep, and made Doctor Cornelius his Lord Chancellor, and confirmed
               the Bulgy Bear in his hereditary office of Marshal of the Lists. And there was great
               applause.</p>
            <p>After this the Telmarine soldiers, firmly but without taunts or blows, were taken
               across the ford and all put under lock and key in the town of Beruna and given beef
               and beer. They made a great fuss about wading the river, for they all hated and
               feared running water just as much as they hated and feared woods and animals. But in
               the end the nuisance was over: and then the nicest part of that long day began.</p>
            <p>Lucy, sitting close to Aslan and divinely comfortable, wondered what the trees were
               doing. At first she thought they were merely dancing; they were certainly going round
               slowly in two circles, one from left to right and the other from right to left. Then
               she noticed that they kept throwing something down in the centre of both circles.
               Sometimes she thought they were cutting off long strands of their hair; at other
               times it looked as if they were breaking off bits of their fingers--but, if so, they
               had plenty of fingers to spare and it did not hurt them. But whatever they were
               throwing down, when it reached the ground, it became brushwood or dry sticks. Then
               three or four of the Red Dwarfs came forward with their tinder boxes and set light to
               the pile, which first crackled, and then blazed, and finally roared as a woodland
               bonfire on midsummer night ought to do. And everyone sat down in a wide circle around
               it.</p>
            <p>Then Bacchus and Silenus and the Maenads began a dance, far wilder than the dance of
               the trees; not merely a dance for fun and beauty (though it was that too) but a magic
               dance of plenty, and where their hands touched, and where their feet fell, the feast
               came into existence--sides of roasted meat that filled the grove with delicious
               smell, and wheaten cakes and oaten cakes, honey and many-coloured sugars and cream as
               thick as porridge and as smooth as still water, peaches, nectarines, pomegranates,
               pears, grapes, strawberries, raspberries--pyramids and cataracts of fruit. Then, in
               great wooden cups and bowls and mazers, wreathed with ivy, came the wines; dark,
               thick ones like syrups of mulberry juice, and clear red ones like red jellies
               liquefied, and yellow wines and green wines and yellowy-green and
               greenish-yellow.</p>
            <p>But for the tree people different fare was provided. When Lucy saw Clodsley Shovel
               and his moles scuffling up the turf in various places (which Bacchus had pointed out
               to them) and realised that the trees were going to eat <emph rend="italic"
                  >earth</emph> it gave her rather a shudder. But when she saw the earths that were
               actually brought to them she felt quite different. They began with a rich brown loam
               that looked almost exactly like chocolate; so like chocolate, in fact, that Edmund
               tried a piece of it, but he did not find it at all nice. When the rich loam had taken
               the edge off their hunger, the trees turned to an earth of the kind you see in
               Somerset, which is almost pink. They said it was lighter and sweeter. At the cheese
               stage they had a chalky soil, and then went on to delicate confections of the finest
               gravels powdered with choice silver sand. They drank very little wine, and it made
               the Hollies very talkative: for the most part they quenched their thirst with deep
               draughts of mingled dew and rain, flavoured with forest flowers and the airy taste of
               the thinnest clouds.</p>
            <p>Thus Aslan feasted the Narnians till long after the sunset had died away, and the
               stars had come out; and the great fire, now hotter but less noisy, shone like a
               beacon in the dark woods, and the frightened Telmarines saw it from far away and
               wondered what it might mean. The best thing of all about this feast was that there
               was no breaking up or going away, but as the talk grew quieter and slower, one after
               another would begin to nod and finally drop off to sleep with feet towards the fire
               and good friends on either side, till at last there was silence all round the circle,
               and the chattering of water over stone at the Fords of Beruna could be heard once
               more. But all night Aslan and the Moon gazed upon each other with joyful and
               unblinking eyes.</p>
            <p>Next day messengers (who were chiefly squirrels and birds) were sent all over the
               country with a proclamation to the scattered Telmarines--including, of course, the
               prisoners in Beruna. They were told that Caspian was now King and that Narnia would
               henceforth belong to the Talking Beasts and the Dwarfs and Dryads and Fauns and other
               creatures quite as much as to the men. Any who chose to stay under the new conditions
               might do so; but for those who did not like the idea, Aslan would provide another
               home. Anyone who wished to go there must come to Aslan and the Kings at the Fords of
               Beruna by noon on the fifth day. You may imagine that this caused plenty of
               head-scratching among the Telmarines. Some of them, chiefly the young ones, had, like
               Caspian, heard stories of the Old Days and were delighted that they had come back.
               They were already making friends with the creatures. These all decided to stay in
               Narnia. But most of the older men, especially those who had been important under
               Miraz, were sulky and had no wish to live in a country where they could not rule the
               roast. <said who="bittertelmarines" aloud="true">"Live here with a lot of blooming
                  performing animals! No fear,"</said> they said. <said who="bittertelmarines"
                  aloud="true">"And ghosts too,"</said> some added with a shudder. <said
                  who="bittertelmarines" aloud="true">"That's what those there Dryads really are.
                  It's not canny."</said> They were also suspicious. <said who="bittertelmarines"
                  aloud="true">"I don't trust 'em,"</said> they said. <said who="bittertelmarines"
                  aloud="true">"Not with that awful Lion and all. He won't keep his claws off us
                  long, <emph rend="italic">you'll</emph> see."</said> But then they were equally
               suspicious of his offer to give them a new home. <said who="bittertelmarines"
                  aloud="true">"Take us off to his den and eat us one by one most likely,"</said>
               they muttered. And the more they talked to one another the sulkier and more
               suspicious they became. But on the appointed day more than half of them turned
               up.</p>
            <p>At one end of the glade Aslan had caused to be set up two stakes of wood, higher than
               a man's head and about three feet apart. A third, and lighter, piece of wood was
               bound across them at the top uniting them, so that the whole thing looked like a
               doorway from nowhere into nowhere. In front of this stood Aslan himself with Peter on
               his right and Caspian on his left. Grouped round them were Susan and Lucy, Trumpkin
               and Trufflehunter, the Lord Cornelius, Glenstorm, Reepicheep and others. The children
               and the Dwarfs had made good use of the royal wardrobes in what had been the castle
               of Miraz and was now the castle of Caspian, and what with silk and cloth of gold,
               with snowy linen glancing through slashed sleeves, with silver mail shirts and
               jewelled sword-hilts, with gilt helmets and feathered bonnets, they were almost too
               bright to look at. Even the beasts wore rich chains about their necks. Yet nobody's
               eyes were on them or the children. The living and strokable gold of Aslan's mane
               outshone them all. The rest of the Old Narnians stood down each side of the glade. At
               the far end stood the Telmarines. The sun shone brightly and pennants fluttered in
               the light wind.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="bittertelmarines">"Men of Telmar,"</said> said
               Aslan, <said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="bittertelmarines">"you who seek a new
                  land, hear my words. I will send you all to your own country, which I know and you
                  do not."</said></p>
            <p><said who="bittertelmarines" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"We don't remember Telmar.
                  We don't know where it is. We don't know what it is like,"</said> grumbled the
               Telmarines.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="bittertelmarines">"You came into Narnia out of
                  Telmar,"</said> said Aslan. <said who="aslan" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="bittertelmarines">"But you came into Telmar from another place. You do not
                  belong to this world at all. You came hither, certain generations ago, out of that
                  same world to which the High King Peter belongs."</said></p>
            <p>At this, half the Telmarines began whimpering, <said who="bittertelmarines"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"There you are. Told you so. He's going to kill us
                  all, send us right out of the world,"</said> and the other half began throwing out
               their chests and slapping one another on the back and whispering, <said
                  who="bittertelmarines" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"There you are. Might have
                  guessed we didn't belong to this place with all its queer, nasty, unnatural
                  creatures. We're of royal blood, you'll see."</said> And even Caspian and
               Cornelius and the children turned to Aslan with looks of amazement on their
               faces.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="bittertelmarines">"Peace,"</said> said Aslan
               in the low voice which was nearest to his growl. The earth seemed to shake a little
               and every living thing in the grove became still as stone.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"You, Sir Caspian,"</said> said Aslan,
                  <said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"might have known that you could be no
                  true King of Narnia unless, like the Kings of old, you were a son of Adam and came
                  from the world of Adam's sons. And so you are. Many years ago in that world, in a
                  deep sea of that world which is called the South Sea, a shipload of pirates were
                  driven by storm on an island. And there they did as pirates would: killed the
                  natives and took the native women for wives, and made palm wine, and drank and
                  were drunk, and lay in the shade of the palm trees, and woke up and quarrelled,
                  and sometimes killed one another. And in one of these frays six were put to flight
                  by the rest and fled with their women into the centre of the island and up a
                  mountain, and went, as they thought, into a cave to hide. But it was one of the
                  magical places of that world, one of the chinks or chasms between that world and
                  this. There were many chinks or chasms between worlds in old times, but they have
                  grown rarer. This was one of the last: I do not say <emph rend="italic">the</emph>
                  last. And so they fell, or rose, or blundered, or dropped right through, and found
                  themselves in this world, in the Land of Telmar which was then unpeopled. But why
                  it was unpeopled is a long story: I will not tell it now. And in Telmar their
                  descendants lived and became a fierce and proud people; and after many generations
                  there was a famine in Telmar and they invaded Narnia, which was then in some
                  disorder (but that also would be a long story), and conquered it and ruled it. Do
                  you mark all this well, King Caspian?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"I do indeed, Sir,"</said> said Caspian.
                  <said who="pc" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"I was wishing that I came of a more
                  honourable lineage."</said></p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"You come of the Lord Adam and the Lady
                  Eve,"</said> said Aslan. <said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="pc">"And that is
                  both honour enough to erect the head of the poorest beggar, and shame enough to
                  bow the shoulders of the greatest emperor on earth. Be content."</said></p>
            <p>Caspian bowed.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="bittertelmarines">"And now,"</said> said
               Aslan, <said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="bittertelmarines">"you men and women of
                  Telmar, will you go back to that island in the world of men from which your
                  fathers first came? It is no bad place. The race of those pirates who first found
                  it has died out, and it is without inhabitants. There are good wells of fresh
                  water, and fruitful soil, and timber for building, and fish in the lagoons; and
                  the other men of that world have not yet discovered it. The chasm is open for your
                  return; but this I must warn you, that once you have gone through, it will close
                  behind you for ever. There will be no more commerce between the worlds by that
                  door."</said></p>
            <p>There was silence for a moment. Then a burly, decent-looking fellow among the
               Telmarine soldiers pushed forward and said:</p>
            <p><said who="telsoldier" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"Well, I'll take the
                  offer."</said></p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="telsoldier">"It is well chosen,"</said> said
               Aslan. <said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="telsoldier">"And because you have
                  spoken first, strong magic is upon you. Your future in that world shall be good.
                  Come forth."</said></p>
            <p>The man, now a little pale, came forward. Aslan and his court drew aside, leaving him
               free access to the empty doorway of the stakes.</p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="telsoldier">"Go through it, my son,"</said>
               said Aslan, bending towards him and touching the man's nose with his own. As soon as
               the Lion's breath came about him, a new look came into the man's eyes--startled, but
               not unhappy--as if he were trying to remember something. Then he squared his
               shoulders and walked into the Door.</p>
            <p>Everyone's eyes were fixed on him. They saw the three pieces of wood, and through
               them the trees and grass and sky of Narnia. They saw the man between the doorposts:
               then, in one second, he had vanished utterly.</p>
            <p>From the other end of the glade the remaining Telmarines set up a wailing. <said
                  who="bittertelmarines" aloud="true">"Ugh! What's happened to him? Do you mean to
                  murder us? We won't go that way."</said> And then one of the clever Telmarines
               said:</p>
            <p><said who="clevertel" aloud="true" toWhom="aslan">"We don't see any other world
                  through those sticks. If you want us to believe in it, why doesn't one of <emph
                     rend="italic">you</emph> go? All your own friends are keeping well away from
                  the sticks."</said></p>
            <p>Instantly Reepicheep stood forward and bowed. <said who="rcheep" aloud="true"
                  toWhom="aslan">"If <emph rend="italic">my</emph> example can be of any service,
                  Aslan,"</said> he said, <said who="rcheep" aloud="true" toWhom="asla">"I will take
                  eleven mice through that arch at your bidding without a moment's
               delay."</said></p>
            <p><said who="aslan" aloud="true" toWhom="rcheep">"Nay, little one,"</said> said Aslan,
               laying his velvety paw ever so lightly on Reepicheep's head. <said who="aslan"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="rcheep">"They would do dreadful things to you in that world.
                  They would show you at fairs. It is others who must lead."</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep lp">"Come on,"</said> said Peter suddenly to
               Edmund and Lucy. <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep lp">"Our time's
               up."</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"What do you mean?"</said> said Edmund.</p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep lp">"This way,"</said> said Susan, who seemed
               to know all about it. <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep lp">"Back into the
                  trees. We've got to change."</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"Change what?"</said> asked Lucy.</p>
            <p><said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Our clothes, of course,"</said> said Susan.
                  <said who="sp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Nice fools we'd look on the platform of
                  an English station in <emph rend="italic">these</emph>."</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="sp">"But our other things are at Caspian's
                  castle,"</said> said Edmund.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep">"No, they're not,"</said> said Peter, still
               leading the way into the thickest wood. <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep"
                  >"They're all here. They were brought down in bundles this morning. It's all
                  arranged."</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Was that what Aslan was talking to you and
                  Susan about this morning?"</said> asked Lucy.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Yes--that and other things,"</said> said
               Peter, his face very solemn. <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"I can't tell it
                  to you all. There were things he wanted to say to Su and me because we're not
                  coming back to Narnia."</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Never?"</said> cried Edmund and Lucy in
               dismay.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep lp">"Oh, you two are,"</said> answered Peter.
                  <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="ep lp">"At least, from what he said, I'm
                  pretty sure he means you to get back some day. But not Su and me. He says we're
                  getting too old."</said></p>
            <p><said who="lp" aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"Oh, Peter,"</said> said Lucy. <said who="lp"
                  aloud="true" toWhom="pp">"What awful bad luck. Can you bear it?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"Well, I think I can,"</said> said Peter.
                  <said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="lp">"It's all rather different from what I
                  thought. You'll understand when it comes to your last time. But, quick, here are
                  our things."</said></p>
            <p>It was odd, and not very nice, to take off their royal clothes and to come back in
               their school things (not very fresh now) into that great assembly. One or two of the
               nastier Telmarines jeered. But the other creatures all cheered and rose up in honour
               of Peter the High King, and Queen Susan of the Horn, and King Edmund and Queen Lucy.
               There were affectionate and (on Lucy's part) tearful farewells with all their old
               friends--animal kisses, and hugs from Bulgy Bears, and hands wrung by Trumpkin, and a
               last tickly, whiskerish embrace with Trufflehunter. And of course Caspian offered the
               Horn back to Susan and of course Susan told him to keep it. And then, wonderfully and
               terribly, it was farewell to Aslan himself, and Peter took his place with Susan's
               hands on his shoulders and Edmund's on hers and Lucy's on his and the first of the
               Telmarine's on Lucy's, and so in a long line they moved forward to the Door. After
               that came a moment which is hard to describe, for the children seemed to be seeing
               three things at once. One was the mouth of a cave opening into the glaring green and
               blue of an island in the Pacific, where all the Telmarines would find themselves the
               moment they were through the Door. The second was a glade in Narnia, the faces of
               Dwarfs and Beasts, the deep eyes of Aslan, and the white patches on the Badger's
               cheeks. But the third (which rapidly swallowed up the other two) was the grey,
               gravelly surface of a platform in a country station, and a seat with luggage round
               it, where they were all sitting as if they had never moved from it--a little flat and
               dreary for a moment after all they had been through, but also, unexpectedly, nice in
               its own way, what with the familiar railway smell and the English sky and the summer
               term before them.</p>
            <p><said who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"Well!"</said> said Peter. <said
                  who="pp" aloud="true" toWhom="sp ep lp">"We <emph rend="italic">have</emph> had a
                  time."</said></p>
            <p><said who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"Bother!"</said> said Edmund. <said
                  who="ep" aloud="true" toWhom="pp sp lp">"I've left my new torch in
               Narnia."</said></p>
